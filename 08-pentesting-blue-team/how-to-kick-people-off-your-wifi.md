Do you have an intruder? Don't Panic! The following are steps to react to and expel intruders from your system and specific strategies you can use to isolate and prevent future hacks. In a previous article, we already discussed the process of [wireless intrusion detection](#todo). In this article, we'll address the mitigation process to kick them out!!

> 📝 We need to take intruders seriously, and "kicking them out" is not our only responsibility; we have previously discussed [Intrusion Detection](https://4geeks.com/lesson/intruder-detection-system) and studied different [intrusion detection systems with examples](https://4geeks.com/lesson/intrusion-detection-system-examples) that will help us prevent future intrusions, but also keep in mind that the intruder could have gained access to sensible information, create back-doors, etc. At the end of this lesson, we have additional steps and suggestions to keep your systems safe.

## How do you expel your intruder from your network?

We can start by updating the WIFI password, but if you want an aggressive approach, your goal is to leave our intruder without the internet. There are several programs to help us kick out a user. 

### Netcut 

One example is NetCut. This software allows us to control all the equipment connected to our router.

If we want to kick out one in particular, we can do it easily with this application—one more utility that we have available. Of course, in this case, we must take into account that we will have to install additional software on our computer. We must always download it from official sources and avoid making mistakes that may affect our security.

NetCut is an interesting program that allows us to expel a user from the wireless network. However, we can make use of other similar programs that can also be found for free on the Internet. There is a wide range of possibilities for different operating systems.

### Fing for cell phones

One of the first things we must do if we want to know who is accessing our router is to see the different connections. We can do this easily from the device itself and by accessing the settings, but we can also use a specific application to help us know who is connecting and from which device. Fing is an application that allows us to check simply if someone is using **our Internet if you are a beginner**, and you don't know how you can check it following other steps.

Fing also allows **finding intruders and blocking access** permanently or temporarily. It is an application for Android and iOS that we can download for free on our smartphone and that allows us to detect all the devices connected to the WiFi network.

Simply download the application to your cell phone and turn it on. It will automatically detect the devices that are connected to the network and show them in a list that you can see on your phone: the type of device it is (mobile, TV, game console, device, smart speakers...) and it will also show us the brand, model and **private IP address** of the device within our network.

We can tap inside the one we want to read more details about that device, the model, the release date, the operating system... We can access the settings or manage the device: we can remove it from the list, we can ping it, or access a timeline where we can see the different accesses. That's how easy it will be, with this app, to block someone who is stealing the Internet and avoid as soon as possible that they continue stealing Internet at home.

## Kick-out user using KickThemOut?

[KickThemOut](https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout) is a tool to kick devices out of your network and enjoy all the bandwidth for you. It allows you to select specific devices or all ARP and spoofs from your local area network. It is compatible with Python and Linux (not Windows) and allows you to select specific devices on the network or all connected devices.

## Installing KickThemOut

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

We will also need to have Nmap installed. If we don't have it, we can install it in Debian with the command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install nmap
```

With everything installed and updated, it's time to download the application. For this, we place it where we want to download it, and we clone it from its GitHub repository with the command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/k4m4/kickthemout.git
```
We access the downloaded folder and install the application:

```bash
$ cd kickthemout/
$ sudo python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now it's time to run and test the application:

```bash
$ python kickthemout.py
```

After we run the code, it will ask for 3 options:

1. Option to leave the Internet to a single user.
2. To leave without Internet to one or more selected users.
3. We leave without the Internet at all (TOTAL EVIL).

## Advantages of kicking out users

Unauthorized users can be a big source of problems for our Wi-Fi network and for our own security in many cases. Expelling them brings us different benefits that are very important for maintaining our security and privacy, as well as for the network to work in the right way. These benefits are:

- **Better security**

We must have good security in our network to avoid intruders and expel them at the moment. When our Wi-Fi network is accessed by unauthorized users, it can be a threat to the security of the network and to us. Access to other users' data is much easier. So they can steal personal information, or cause other types of damage to the system. Or even cause some kind of problem or commit a crime from our own network. By expelling them, we reduce this possibility in a very considerable way. Since, if any crime is committed from the network, the first responsible will be the owner of the network.

- **Better speed**

The more users there are on the network, the lower the speed and bandwidth that can be distributed. This will be noticed when we use our Internet connection to carry out any activity, worsening considerably the quality of the connection. By expelling users, we freed up the bandwidth they were using, thus improving the speed and overall performance of the network.

- **Increased privacy**

By ejecting unauthorized users, we greatly reduce the possibility that they **can access personal information**, which can be very sensitive. By expelling them, we considerably improve the privacy of all users. It is a good way to protect ourselves and to prevent all kinds of practices being carried out with our IP address or using our Internet access to do so.

- **Complying with regulations**

When it comes to any company or organization, having unauthorized users may mean that they are not complying with any rules or regulations. By expelling these users, we ensure that we comply with these regulations. This reduces the risk of a fine or sanction.

## Immediate Actions after intrusion detection

1. **Immediate Containment:** We previously talked about strategies for [incident management and containment](https://4geeks.com/lesson/incident-management-detect-evaluate), use advanced network segmentation and isolation techniques to limit the intruder's movement within the network.

2. **Advanced Threat Hunting:** Employ threat hunting techniques to identify lateral movement, persistence mechanisms, and any potential backdoors the intruder may have installed.

3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the intrusion, including timeline creation, identifying compromised accounts, and assessing data access or exfiltration.

4. **Incident Response (IR) Plan Execution:** According to the incident management process and best practices we have previously discussed, you should have a IR plan, which should include specific actions like incident categorization, communication protocols, and detailed post-incident review.

5. **Deploy Advanced Threat Detection Tools:** Utilize tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) or SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) to automate response actions and enhance threat visibility.

6. **Engage in Legal and Compliance Actions:** Ensure that any required notifications to regulatory bodies, clients, or stakeholders are made, and prepare for any legal proceedings if necessary.

7. **Reconstruction and Remediation:** After the intruder is removed, focus on rebuilding and reinforcing affected systems with stronger security measures, possibly rearchitecting parts of the network to better resist future attacks.

The operation is very simple, it is only to introduce the number of the operation that we want to carry out to carry out it. We can see an example that I have stopped in the middle, only to show the operation.
