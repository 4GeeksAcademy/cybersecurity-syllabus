They are an alternative to packet filters since they support filters at the application level instead of at the network and transport level. They act for an application protocol and **there is a *proxy* process for each protocol to be filtered**. A *proxy* server resides between the clients and the real server, intercepts requests from clients for particular services, evaluates them, and decides which traffic is allowed and which traffic is blocked.

**Proxy Server Architecture**

## Advantages of proxy servers:

- Solves problems presented by packet filters, as it allows filtering at the application level can be filtered by specific protocol operations.
- E.g. in ftp, you could set a rule to block all *put* commands and no one would be able to upload files to the server.
- ftp scheme-related problems disappear as the *proxy* changes the port number used in the sessions to maintain the state of the two sessions.
- You can have a separate process per protocol, you don't have to try to do everything at once.
- It is easy to restrict access to a service: no *proxy*, no service.
- Simplify filtering rules at the router. Only traffic to the application gateway should be allowed and all other traffic blocked.
- Allows a degree of concealment of the protected network structure. The *proxy* name will be the only one available to the outside.

### Disadvantages of proxy servers:

- As one *proxy* process operates per service, you must have a multitude of them, if you want to cater for the filtering of many protocols.
- You may have to use different clients, servers, or both.
- They can become a bottleneck for traffic.

### Types of proxy servers

- A generic system, SOCKS, requires different clients than the typical ones, it is not popular.
A proxy Server, such as Microsoft's, is a *software* package that allows *proxying* of ftp, http, and nntp protocols.
- TIS FWTK, from *Trusted Information Systems*, which includes different types of *proxy* servers. Among others, it includes proxies for Telnet, FTP, Rlogin, Sendmail, HTTP, etc.

**What can be improved?**

- Work with “*stateful inspection*” technology.
- Bring together several of the technologies, along with different types of authentication systems, AAA, to create much more sophisticated firewalls.
- With all the available technologies, create different security architectures and topologies around the firewall.

## Is a gateway the same as a firewall?

No, a gateway is not the same as a firewall, although both can play important roles in network management and security. The difference between the two is explained below:

### Gateway (Gateway)

**Primary Function:**
- A gateway acts as an entry and exit point in a network, allowing communication between different networks that may have different protocols. Its main function is the translation of addresses and protocols.

**Types of Gateway:**
- **Default Gateway:** Generally, a router that connects a local area network (LAN) to other networks (e.g., the Internet).
- **Protocol Gateway:** Allows communication between networks using different protocols (e.g. IP to IPX).
- **Application Gateway:** Translates messages at the application level (e.g., a proxy server that translates HTTP to HTTPS protocols).

**Example:**
- In a home network, the router that connects the internal network to the Internet acts as a gateway.

### Firewall (Firewall)

**Main Function:**
- A firewall is a device or software used to control access between different networks, applying security policies to allow or deny traffic based on predefined rules. Its main function is to protect the internal network from unauthorized access and attacks.

**Types of Firewall
- **Network Firewall:** Device that controls traffic between networks (e.g. between a LAN and the Internet).
- **Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects web applications by controlling and filtering HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- **Personal Firewall: Software that protects individual devices by controlling network traffic to and from the device.

**Example:**
- A firewall can be configured to block all unsolicited incoming traffic from the Internet, allowing only traffic that is initiated from the internal network.

### Gateway vs. Firewall Comparison:

| **Feature** | **Gateway** | **Firewall** |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
**Main Function** | Connecting different networks and translating protocols | Protecting the network by controlling and filtering the traffic | **Primary **Function** | Connecting different networks and translating protocols | Protecting the network by controlling and filtering the traffic |
**Common Location** | | Network router, application proxy | Edge router, dedicated device, software |
**Security** | | Not its primary function, although it may have certain security functionalities | Primary function is network security |
| **Examples of Usage** | Connecting a LAN to the Internet, translating IP addresses | Blocking unauthorized traffic, preventing attacks |

In summary, although a gateway and a firewall can work together and in some cases, the same device can perform both functions, their main roles in a network are different. A gateway facilitates communication between different networks, while a firewall protects the network by controlling traffic and enforcing security policies.
