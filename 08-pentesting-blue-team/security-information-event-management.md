## What is a SIEM?

SIEM or Security Information and Event Management is a software category that aims to provide organizations with useful information about potential security threats to their business-critical networks through data standardization and prioritization. This is made possible through a centralized analysis of security data obtained from multiple systems, including antivirus applications, firewalls, and intrusion prevention solutions.

SIEM solutions are hybrid solutions for product categories such as SIM (*Security Information Management*) and SEM (*Security Event Manager*). SIEM technology analyzes security alerts generated by network hardware and software. SIEM solutions can come as software, application, or service management, and are also used to record security data and generate reports for compliance purposes.

### SEM

The first area of security management deals with real-time monitoring, event correlation, notifications and console views commonly referred to as Security Event Management.
 
### SIM

Provides long-term storage, analysis, and communication of event data, and is known as **Security Information Management*.

### Security Information Management

The term ***Security Information and Event Management*** describes multiple capabilities such as the collection, analysis and presentation of information from the network and security devices. Added to this are identity and access management applications, vulnerability management and compliance policy tools, operating systems, databases, logs, and external threat data. The key is to monitor and help control user and service privileges, directory services, and other system configuration changes, as well as provide data for event auditing, review, and incident response.

Detection of events of interest can be through any of the functional groups, with SEM support, capable of real-time monitoring; and SIM, which provides an effective means of comparing the large number of events collected. SIEMs are designed to collect security events from a wide variety of sources within an organization. Once the SIEM has the events, it processes the data to standardize it, performs analysis of the “normalized” data, generates alerts when it detects anomalous activity and produces reports at the request of administrators. Some SIEM products can also act to block malicious activity.

## Why is it important to have a SIEM?

It's no secret that security threats are continually increasing, and can come from both internal and external sources. A growing concern is the possibility that employees may accidentally misconfigure security settings, leaving data vulnerable to attack. To prevent these problems, IT organizations have incorporated various systems to protect against intrusions and a host of other threats.

The disadvantage of these protection systems is that they generate so much information to monitor that IT teams face the problem of having to interpret it in its entirety to recognize real problems. The volume of Security data flowing into understaffed IT Security teams is mostly useless unless it can be quickly analyzed and filtered into actionable alerts. Considering the amount of data this can become, it is no longer possible for organizations to do this analysis manually. This is where SIEM software comes in.

With an SIEM, IT professionals have an effective method to automate their processes and centralize security management in a way that helps simplify the difficult task of protecting sensitive information. An SIEM gives experts a head start in understanding the difference between a low-risk threat and one that can be business-defining.

> 🔥 Data standardization is critical.

The ability to have Security data flowing into a centralized view of your infrastructure is effective only if that data can be standardized. This means that, despite the thousands or millions of entries coming from different systems and sources, everything can be put into a common format, ready for the SIEM solution to run its analysis and correlation. This reduces your team's workload and allows you to take advantage of an optimized view of activity and potential concerns.

## Key functionalities of a SIEM solution

Available SIEM solutions share commonalities that are important to your operations. You must have the ability to:

- Centralize the view of potential threats.
- Determine which threats require resolution and which are just noise.
- Escalate issues to the appropriate security analysts, so they can take prompt action.
- Include the context of security events to enable well-informed resolutions.
- Document, in an audit log, the events detected and how they were resolved.
- Comply with industry regulations in a simple reporting format.

## The role of SIEMs in regulatory compliance

SIEMs have gained popularity among large companies that must comply with PCI DSS (the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). In addition, it has very useful applications that help compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), among others. These laws require companies to have mechanisms in place that allow them to detect threats and resolve them quickly. This means you need to know what is happening across a broad spectrum of your IT infrastructure, whether in on-premises, cloud, or hybrid environments.

A SIEM solution is critical to get the information you need to monitor data and act quickly on threats that are determined to be a cause for alarm. When all of this activity is captured in a detailed audit trail, auditors can see that your company is taking the necessary steps to protect your data.

## Examples of SIEM in action

A SIEM can be used to detect any number of Security threats, including the presence of ransomware, unauthorized data access, failed log-in attempts that don't match standard log-in issues, and unusual spikes in bandwidth. Whether these threats come from internal or external sources, the software can send a prioritized alert notifying your team of the potential problem so that it can be investigated immediately. As Security threats evolve, SIEM solutions become a critical component in providing organizations with a secure environment for their data.

## Real-time detection capabilities

Security Event Management (SEM) provides real-time or near real-time tools and functionality to facilitate the management of security-related events by evaluating events and correlating information from different sources. By not relying on a single source of information, as IDS/IPS do, the event management feature can help reduce the number of false positives by ensuring that the event that has been discovered is communicated to all other systems. As the database is updated it becomes more effective and better differentiates security incidents from common event patterns.

Advanced SEM technologies support data visualization capabilities, which can help the security analyst quickly assess events and trends. Threat analysis functions and event prioritization provide extra assistance to security operations personnel, as they can concentrate their efforts on investigating events that have the highest threat ratings.

## SEM in industry

The tools and functionality provided by the security event manager are often very competitive in the industrial sector. Due to the use of proprietary protocols of the industrial elements, extensive learning is required; but due to the few changes occurring in the network and its high stability, it provides high security by being able to easily detect any connection or message outside the usual transmission between machines.

## Event file management

SIM functions are characterized by **non-real-time** data analysis, through the collection and standardization of disparate systems and centralized application information (e.g., system events, audit trails, event logs, and transaction logs).

The security analyst can query the archive and retrieve information through standardized queries; storing information from different systems in one place, in a chronological and formalized manner.

Advanced SIM technologies can evaluate these stored events, as they are collected or on demand, to examine anomalous behavior in future analysis.

Forensic analysis is aided by event management functions, while centralized events help manage retention times to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Reporting capabilities can simplify an organization's internal assessments and audit cycles.

SIEM systems provide event detection through real-time evaluation of information and forensic analysis of previously stored events.

The operation to analyze the network is based on rules and signatures, although it also supports the creation of new scripts using the LUA language. It has standardized inputs and outputs to formats such as YAML that allow it to easily integrate with other tools such as SIEM or databases. By engaging the open source community and the most important set of IDS/IPS rule resources available, OISF has built the Suricata engine to simplify the process of maintaining the optimal security level. Through strategic partnerships, OISF is leveraging the expertise of Emerging Threats and other leading industry resources to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive rules available.

## SIM in the industry

Data collection functions are perfect for auditing processes. Fortunately, the data recorded by sensors is usually very homogeneous in networks where equipment is not modified over long periods. Any anomalies in protocols, values, or timing are easily detectable, and changes caused by possible network attacks can be seen instantly.

## Understanding a SIEM

SIEMs require a great deal of planning before implementation begins, identifying and preventing security breaches. Implementation is often stated as daunting for a large number of companies, often being outsourced, as it is difficult to adjust and can take considerable time before the desired results are achieved.

Several reasons could lead a company to implement an SIEM, from compliance with a government or industry standard to having been the victim of a cyber attack or perhaps obtaining a certain level of security before signing a contract. Regardless of the conviction, when a company decides to implement an SIEM, it will take a lot of effort before it starts to see results.

## SIEM implementation in industrial networks

The implementation of a SIEM in an OT network involves several difficulties:

- **Very long life cycles:** The most common problem in industrial systems comes from the life cycle, often between 20 and 40 years depending on the type of industry. Adding security elements to the network or equipment may affect, modify, or delay the communication signal of PLCs or other equipment, due to the low processing power available. This can lead to problems associated with the compatibility and operation of the equipment on the network.
- **Performance**: The computers found in industrial networks, as well as the industrial devices themselves, are often underpowered, outdated, and out of date, with just the right capabilities for the control tasks assigned to them. Modern anti-virus, IDS/IPS and other tools required for log processing can lead to incompatibilities, device downtime, or even general system malfunction.
- **Personnel**: The employees and technicians required to manage SIEMs must also have sufficient knowledge to understand the protocols and equipment of the industrial network to be able to correctly interpret the events generated.

## SIEM implementation considerations

Implementing an SIEM requires a thorough knowledge of the network topology and its protocols and a clear understanding of what it is expected to do. The best way to implement an SIEM is through its two most important separate components, the management of logging and monitoring capabilities on the one hand and the response to alerts on the other. The first task for the organization will be to know what it considers to be a critical asset and then move on to the study of its protection.

Some companies have a variety of events to collect and process in different ways. Before the SIEM system will be able to provide useful reports, the various events will need to be standardized so that the data is consistent. Before a company can take full advantage of its SIEM, it must configure the system to handle the data collected from each type of device, determine how and where the data is stored, and how incidents generate alerts. In addition, it is crucial to manage scheduling, which can also influence the generation of these alerts.

Each SIEM has its own set of requirements for event collection. There are many types of event sources, but generally, Syslog and Windows event logs cover 75% or more of an enterprise environment. Security is a process, not a tactical operation. To get the best measurable results from your SIEM investment, you need to choose the best situations to deploy sensors in the network.

## The path to SIEM success

Making a SIEM work properly to be efficient and effective for the enterprise requires following a series of steps and measures:

- Collect events from standard security sources.
- Enrich events with supplementary data from other sources.
- Apply global threat intelligence (blacklists).
- Correlate the collected information.
- Investigate the events generated, following up and correcting them.
- Document actions to be taken, standard operating procedures, service level agreements, and trouble tickets.
- Incorporate new information into SIEM by creating whitelists or new content.

> 💡 In some cases, an organization might choose to outsource SIEM management to a company specializing in security. In IT systems, management is carried out from the security company's facilities, but in OT systems it is more common for one or more technicians from the security company to travel to work together in the industry.

## In-house vs. outsourced management

The benefit of a dedicated SIEM is that the company's data never goes outside, giving the company control over the hardware and events stored. They can configure correlations (rules), reporting, retention periods, and other settings to meet their needs. However, internally managed SIEMs can present problems in terms of staffing or assigned personnel being required for other projects or functions.

Managing an SIEM requires specialized training and standard operating procedures that must be created and maintained for each environment. An outsourced approach requires events to be sent to the administrator, leading to a loss of visibility.

The disadvantages a customer faces when outsourcing an SIEM include a lack of visibility and the inability to switch vendors while maintaining older events. This lack of visibility creates problems when looking for new threats. Since managed service providers typically specialize in one SIEM vendor, they are more efficient and generally have greater operational expertise.

## Capabilities of a SIEM

- **Data aggregation**: SEM/LM solutions for managing logs from multiple sources, including networks, security, servers, databases, and applications, provide the ability to consolidate monitored data to avoid missing crucial events.
- **Correlation**: Identifies common attributes and relates events in packets or incidents. This technology applies correlation techniques to integrate different sources and convert data into useful information.
- **Alerting**: Automated analysis of correlated events generates alerts that are sent to the administrator.
- **Dashboards**: SIEM/LM tools transform data into informative charts and graphs, helping to recognize patterns or identify anomalous activity.
- **Compliance**: SIEM applications can be used to automate data collection and reporting in compliance with current regulations.
- **Retention**: SIEM/SIM solutions provide long-term data storage, a critical process in forensic investigation, as it is unlikely to discover a network breach at the exact moment it occurs.
- **Redundancy**: Although correlation engines are not required to be redundant, it is highly recommended that the database be redundant to avoid loss of information.
- **Scalability**: Allows the system to be configured hierarchically, enabling it to grow as needed.

## Cloud-based SIEM options

One approach that is starting to grow is SIEM as a service in the cloud. While cloud providers might offer special programs for SIEMaaS (SIEM as a Service) customers for the first time, larger providers want to offer SIEM solutions as well. Vendors need to recognize that events are customer property, and customers need to understand that events may contain confidential company information.

It is recommended that if the company collects protected data, an agreement should be signed between the two to ensure that the data is handled appropriately. Unlike traditional, cloud-based SIEM software is generally billed on a usage model basis, rather than per server or user. However, if the SIEM software sends all events to the cloud, or is otherwise configured incorrectly, the cost of bandwidth from the cloud provider could be high.

Smaller companies may find greater benefits in using a service provider that offers SaaS-based security or a managed security service provider (MSSP) that will provide some of the ongoing demands.

## SIEM Open Source

There is a multitude of offerings and options, in this study we will focus on one of the best-known and most popular SIEMs, it is Security Onion, developed by Doug Burks, creating an implementation or union of all the free programs for working with IDS/IPS in a very easy to install way, allowing to install third-party software such as Splunk via applications.

There are many other SIEMs, also effective against threats, but they may have associated costs or maybe less used. To speak of other possibilities, we have as an example:
