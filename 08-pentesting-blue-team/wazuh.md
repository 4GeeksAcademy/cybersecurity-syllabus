- Regulatory compliance: Assists in meeting various compliance standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. Generates compliance reports and helps track adherence to regulatory requirements.

- Cloud security monitoring: Extends security monitoring capabilities to cloud environments. Provides visibility and threat detection across multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructures.

- Container security: Monitors and secures containerized environments like Docker and Kubernetes. Detects vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and runtime threats in container ecosystems.

- Integration with external tools: Offers seamless integration with various security and IT management tools. Enhances overall security posture by combining Wazuh's capabilities with other specialized solutions.

## Wazuh Architecture

Wazuh follows a client-server architecture:

- Wazuh agents: Lightweight programs installed on monitored systems
- Wazuh server: Analyzes data collected by agents
- Elastic Stack: Indexes and stores alert data
- Wazuh dashboard: Web interface for data visualization and management

## Wazuh as an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)

### Endpoint monitoring and data collection

Wazuh agents continuously collect and analyze data from endpoints, including system logs, file changes, and network activity. This comprehensive monitoring provides real-time visibility into the security posture of each endpoint. The collected data is then securely transmitted to the Wazuh server for further analysis and correlation.

### Threat detection and response

Leveraging its advanced rule set and machine learning capabilities, Wazuh can identify potential threats and anomalies in real-time. When a threat is detected, Wazuh can automatically initiate response actions, such as isolating an infected endpoint or blocking malicious IP addresses. This rapid detection and response mechanism significantly reduces the potential impact of security incidents.

### File integrity monitoring

Wazuh's file integrity monitoring (FIM) feature tracks changes to critical files and directories on monitored systems. It can detect unauthorized modifications, additions, or deletions of files, helping to identify potential security breaches or malicious activities. FIM also aids in compliance by ensuring that important system files remain unaltered and secure.

## Wazuh as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

### Log collection and analysis
Wazuh excels at gathering logs from diverse sources, including operating systems, applications, and network devices. It employs advanced parsing techniques to extract meaningful data, enabling comprehensive security analysis and threat detection.

### Real-time alerting and monitoring
The platform provides instant notifications for potential security incidents, allowing rapid response to threats. Its real-time monitoring capabilities offer continuous visibility into system activities, helping to maintain a proactive security posture.

### Compliance reporting and auditing
Wazuh simplifies compliance management by automating the generation of reports for various regulatory standards. It also facilitates thorough auditing processes, tracking system changes and user activities to ensure adherence to security policies and regulations.


### Comparison of Wazuh with Other Popular SIEM/EDR Systems

To measure the effectiveness of SIEM/EDR systems for enterprises, we'll focus on key features that are crucial for comprehensive security management. Here's a comparison table of Wazuh with three other popular SIEM/EDR systems:

| Feature | Wazuh | Splunk | IBM QRadar | LogRhythm |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Log Collection & Analysis | Comprehensive | Extensive | Advanced | Robust |
| Real-time Alerting | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Threat Intelligence Integration | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| File Integrity Monitoring | Built-in | Via add-ons | Limited | Yes |
| Compliance Reporting | Extensive | Comprehensive | Advanced | Extensive |
| Scalability | High | Very High | High | High |
| Cloud Integration | Strong | Excellent | Good | Good |
| Machine Learning Capabilities | Basic | Advanced | Advanced | Advanced |
| User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) | Limited | Advanced | Advanced | Advanced |
| Cost | Open Source | High | High | Moderate to High |
| Ease of Deployment | Moderate | Complex | Complex | Moderate |
| Custom Rule Creation | Flexible | Highly Flexible | Flexible | Flexible |
| Third-party Integrations | Good | Extensive | Extensive | Good |

This comparison highlights that while Wazuh offers robust features comparable to commercial solutions, especially in areas like log collection, real-time alerting, and compliance reporting, it may have some limitations in advanced analytics and UEBA compared to more established commercial products. However, its open-source nature and strong core features make it an attractive option for many enterprises, especially those looking for a cost-effective solution with good customization capabilities.

### Honeypot Integration

While Wazuh itself is not primarily designed as a honeypot solution, it can be effectively integrated with honeypots to enhance its threat detection and analysis capabilities. Here's how Wazuh can work with honeypots:

1. **Log Collection**: Wazuh can collect and analyze logs from honeypots, providing valuable insights into attacker behavior and techniques.

2. **Alert Generation**: When a honeypot detects suspicious activity, Wazuh can generate alerts based on this information, allowing for quick response to potential threats.

3. **Threat Intelligence**: Data gathered from honeypots can be used to enhance Wazuh's threat intelligence, improving its overall detection capabilities.

4. **Correlation**: Wazuh can correlate honeypot data with other security events, providing a more comprehensive view of the threat landscape.

To integrate a honeypot with Wazuh, you would typically:

1. Set up a honeypot (e.g., Cowrie for SSH, Dionaea for various protocols)
2. Configure the honeypot to send logs to Wazuh
3. Create custom Wazuh rules to analyze and alert on honeypot activity

Example of a Wazuh rule for honeypot activity:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "10000",
  "description": "Honeypot detected suspicious activity"
}
```
