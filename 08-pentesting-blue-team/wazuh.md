## Wazuh as an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)

### Endpoint monitoring and data collection

Wazuh agents continuously collect and analyze data from endpoints, including system logs, file changes, and network activity. This comprehensive monitoring provides real-time visibility into the security posture of each endpoint. The collected data is then securely transmitted to the Wazuh server for further analysis and correlation.

### Threat detection and response

Leveraging its advanced rule set and machine learning capabilities, Wazuh can identify potential threats and anomalies in real-time. When a threat is detected, Wazuh can automatically initiate response actions, such as isolating an infected endpoint or blocking malicious IP addresses. This rapid detection and response mechanism significantly reduces the potential impact of security incidents.

### File integrity monitoring

Wazuh's file integrity monitoring (FIM) feature tracks changes to critical files and directories on monitored systems. It can detect unauthorized modifications, additions, or deletions of files, helping to identify potential security breaches or malicious activities. FIM also aids in compliance by ensuring that important system files remain unaltered and secure.


## Wazuh as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
