For **Day 22: Network Defense**, a practical project can help reinforce the concepts learned about network security. Here’s a project idea that aligns with the day’s topics:

### **Project: Building and Securing a Network with a DMZ**

**Objective:**
Create a simulated network environment that includes a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), configure firewalls, gateways, and network detection systems, and ensure network security.

**Components:**
1. **Network Design:**
   - Design a network layout that includes a DMZ, internal network, and external network.
   - Set up virtual machines or use a network simulation tool to create the network environment.

2. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Configure firewalls to segment the network into DMZ and internal networks.
   - Set up firewall rules to control traffic between the internal network, DMZ, and external network.

3. **DMZ Setup:**
   - Deploy services in the DMZ such as a web server, mail server, or DNS server.
   - Ensure that the DMZ is isolated from the internal network but still accessible from the external network.

4. **Gateway or Proxy Server:**
   - Configure a gateway or proxy server to manage traffic between the internal network and the external network.
   - Implement access control policies on the proxy server.

5. **Network Detection and Response (NDR):**
   - Deploy and configure NDR tools to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activities.
   - Set up alerts and logging for network events.

6. **Security Testing:**
   - Perform network scans and vulnerability assessments using tools like Nmap to identify potential security issues.
   - Test the firewall rules and network segmentation to ensure that unauthorized access is prevented.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document the network design, firewall rules, and security configurations.
   - Prepare a report summarizing the project, including any vulnerabilities discovered and the steps taken to address them.

**Deliverables:**
- Network topology diagram with DMZ and security controls
- Configured firewall and gateway/proxy settings
- Screenshots or logs of NDR tool alerts and network scans
- Project report with findings and recommendations

This project will give participants hands-on experience with configuring and securing a network environment, applying the concepts of network defense, firewalls, DMZ, and network detection and response.
