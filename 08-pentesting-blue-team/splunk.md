## What is Splunk used for and how does it work?

Splunk, a widely recognized security information and event management (SIEM) software platform, has become a powerful solution in the cyber security field. This article explores exactly what you're looking for. This comprehensive guide can help you understand what Splunk is and what it is used for. We will illustrate its key features, main use cases, and advantages, and compare it to other SIEM tools. Without further ado, let's answer “what Splunk is used for” in the cybersecurity world.

## What is Splunk?

In today's data-driven cyber landscape, organizations around the world are faced with an ever-increasing volume of data from a variety of network assets and infrastructures. To harness the power of this data and enable cyber resilience, they need tools and technologies that can help them effectively collect, analyze, and visualize logs and events to detect and prevent cyber security threats.

Splunk is a powerful SIEM (security information and event management) tool that is widely used to solve this purpose. It provides a comprehensive platform for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data to gain valuable insights and detect potential security threats. Although Splunk is generally considered an SIEM tool, it was recently renamed Unified Security and Observability Platform and Splunk is now offered as Splunk Cloud, Splunk Enterprise, and Splunk Observability Cloud platforms.

![Splunk4](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/splunk4.png?raw=true)

## Splunk architecture

**1. Carriers:**

- **Universal Forwarder**: a lightweight component installed on data sources to collect and forward data to the Splunk indexer. It has minimal resource requirements and is suitable for high-volume data sources.
- **Heavy Forwarder**: a more feature-rich version of the universal forwarder that allows for pre-processing of data before indexing. It is suitable for environments requiring additional data manipulation.

**2. Load Balancer (LB):**

A load balancer in Splunk helps distribute incoming network traffic evenly among multiple Splunk instances or servers. It acts as a mediator between Splunk clients and backend instances, ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed and efficiently managed.

**3. HTTP Event Collector (HEC):**

Allows events to be sent to Splunk over HTTP. Allows external sources to send data to Splunk for indexing and analysis.

**4. Indexer:**

- **Indexer cluster**: Multiple indexers can be configured in a cluster to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Indexers receive data from forwarders, index it and make it searchable.

**5. Search head:**

- **Group of search heads**: The search head is responsible for handling search requests and presenting the results. A group of search heads can be configured for load balancing and redundancy.
- **Search head clustering**: distributes search requests among a group of search heads, optimizing performance and providing fault tolerance.

**6. Deployment modules:**

- **Deployment Server**: manages forwarder configurations, ensuring consistency across the environment. Simplifies the process of deploying and managing Splunk components.
- **Deployment Manager**: Facilitates configuration management across multiple Splunk instances. Ensures consistency and simplifies the deployment process.

**7. Master License:**

Manages licenses for all Splunk components in the environment. Ensures that usage complies with licensing agreements.

**8. Monitoring Console:**

Provides a centralized interface to monitor the status and performance of the Splunk deployment. Helps administrators track component status and troubleshoot problems.

**9. Data ingestion:**

Various mechanisms for ingesting data into Splunk, including file monitoring, scripted inputs, modular scripted inputs, and various protocol-based inputs.
