### Nessus How to find vulnerabilities?

Nessus is a tool widely used during Pentesting, specifically, in the Scanning phase. This post will be divided into two parts: the first part consists of a very brief overview of Nessus as a product and, in the second part, a demonstration of Nessus is given.

Nessus is the vulnerability detection engine belonging to the company Tenable and is practically the standard tool for this process. There are other similar tools for vulnerability detection, some with free versions such as OpenVAS, and others with very good performance such as Qualys.

Tenable uses its free version of the Nessus vulnerability detection engine for small environments, which at the same time allows it to begin to internalize the vulnerability management process. This is why we will install Nessus in a Windows environment as a proof of concept and as a practice lab, without preventing its use in a small network environment such as a home or small business.

Threats will always be present both externally and internally in any type of equipment, but there is no doubt that when talking about corporate environments or equipment where there is confidential and extremely sensitive information, there is a risk of information theft becoming a real headache. To prevent this there is a Linux distribution that is specially developed for all issues related to vulnerability analysis.

> 💡 Kali Linux provides the user with more than 600 penetration tools, but this amount can be increased by using extra tools and one of the most striking is Nessus.

### What is Nessus?

It is a tool mainly used to scan for vulnerabilities, it is developed and maintained by [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/). It has an engine for scanning targets that are based on plugins; plugins are small programs written in a scripting language called **Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL)** that tell the engine what to evaluate in the target, to determine the flaws in the target.

Nessus has been developed as a remote security scanning tool that scans the remote computer to generate alerts and in case of detecting any vulnerability that puts at risk both the information and the data hosted there. To do this it performs more than 1200 checks on the destination to analyze up to the last byte the presence of any software that is harmful.

### How many plugins does Nessus have and who develops them?

Currently, Nessus has more than 133,088 plugins, most of these plugins are developed by the people at Tenable and a few by the community.

### What kind of licenses are there?

When thinking about purchasing Nessus you will find the following options:

- **Nessus Essentials**: A version that is intended for home use, it can perform scans on up to 16 IP addresses.
- **Professional Nessus**: Commercial version that allows unlimited host scans, it is focused on consultants and Pen Testers.
- **Tenable.io:** This version is more focused on vulnerability management in companies of any size.

### Nessus main features

Among the main features of Nessus we highlight:

- Nessus performs a complete analysis of the server's configuration and does not stop at traditional scans.
- It has updated information about new vulnerabilities and attacks that can put data and information at risk.
- Nessus is open source
- Nessus is capable of being deployed on various platforms, including Raspberry Pi
- Dynamically compiled plug-ins are available to improve the performance and efficiency of scanning tasks
- Integrates more than 450 preconfigured templates for better management of vulnerabilities to detect
- We can create custom reports to get access to the information generated.

> 📖 Nessus works by performing a scan on each port of the equipment to determine the type of service that is running and thus perform tests to validate that the service does not have or present vulnerabilities that affect the normal operation.

### Minimum requirements

![Nessus19](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus19.png?raw=true)

Wait for the installation to finish, it may prompt you to install additional necessary components:

![Nessus20](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus20.png?raw=true)

![Nessus21](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus21.png?raw=true)

![Nessus22](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus22.png?raw=true)

![Nessus23](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus23.png?raw=true)

The WinPcap driver must be installed with the option to start it at system startup, as shown in the picture:

![Nessus24](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus24.png?raw=true)

Finish the installation of additional components:

![Nessus25](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus25.png?raw=true)

Finish Nessus installation:

![Nessus26](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus26.png?raw=true)

Then start the system browser at localhost:8834

![Nessus27](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus27.png?raw=true)

As the secure connection certificate is self signed we must accept the option to login despite the security warnings:

![Nessus28](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus28.png?raw=true)

In the next step, we choose Nessus Essentials:

![Nessus29](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus29.png?raw=true)

As we already have our activation code, in this case, we press Skip, otherwise at this stage we can request an activation code that will arrive at the indicated email:

![Nessus30](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus30.png?raw=true)

Enter the activation code:

![Nessus31](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus31.png?raw=true)

Create an administrator user account, in this example I named it “admin”:

![Nessus32](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus32.png?raw=true)

We wait for it to compile the rest of the system and update the vulnerability information:

![Nessus33](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus33.png?raw=true)

![Nessus34](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus34.png?raw=true)

Once this is complete, the first time we log in it will ask us to enter our current network segment to perform a computer scan, usually the home network is 192.168.0.0/24. In my case it is 192.168.1.0/24, this can be easily seen on Windows by entering the “ipconfig” command.

![Nessus35](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus35.png?raw=true)

Here we take the first 3 octets of our network address as a base, assuming that we are in a segment with mask 24 (standard home configuration), therefore the network segment that I must analyze is 192.168.1.0/24

![Nessus36](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus36.png?raw=true)

Once the asset search is started, you will be prompted to select the assets on which you want to perform an initial vulnerability scan:

![Nessus37](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus37.png?raw=true)

![Nessus38](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus38.png?raw=true)

I select all those that are in my network and I want to analyze, in my case, I will not analyze the IP 1 since it is one of the home routers:

![Nessus39](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus39.png?raw=true)

Once we start the analysis, the assets will appear with the corresponding findings

![Nessus40](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus40.png?raw=true)

Once this analysis is finished we will be able to see that we have already performed a host discovery and a basic analysis of the network, we go to “My Basic Network Scan”:

![Nessus41](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus41.png?raw=true)

All the scanned hosts and their vulnerabilities will appear.

![Nessus42](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus42.png?raw=true)

Entering the details of each host, we can see what are the findings of each one

![Nessus43](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus43.png?raw=true)

And then in each vulnerability:

![Nessus44](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus44.png?raw=true)

We can also see the details of each vulnerability and suggested remediation:

![Nessus45](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nessus45.png?raw=true)

### Conclusion

Nessus Essentials is a relatively simple way to search for vulnerabilities in small home or small business environments, its free capacity of 16 IP maximum allows us to perform various types of security hole searches on our computers, and at the same time provides the ability to know how to fix these problems.
