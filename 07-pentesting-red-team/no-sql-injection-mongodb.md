One of the most infamous NoSQL injection attacks occurred in 2018 when a major data breach at the company Exactis resulted in the exposure of millions of user records. This breach was caused by a NoSQL Injection vulnerability, which allowed attackers to manipulate the database queries and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. 

NoSQL Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unvalidated or malicious data is entered into a NoSQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query to obtain sensitive information, delete data, or execute malicious code on the server.

The consequences of a NoSQL Injection can be severe and varied, depending on the type of data stored in the database and the attackers' ability to exploit the vulnerability.

Like any injection attack, it consists of using an attack vector that, when executed in the application, allows us to alter its operation to obtain information, modify it or skip the login process. Although not using the SQL language can make it more difficult to execute a code injection, it is not a sufficient defense against these attacks.

It is true that tools such as SQLMap, which serve to automate and facilitate SQL injection attacks, would no longer work. However, there are also exploits for other common language types such as MongoDB.

Simply put, the attacker will need another syntax if he wants to do a code injection into a different database. However, the configuration of such a page must be done rigorously if you want to avoid a dangerous NoSQL injection attack, which could lead to the same consequences as one with SQL. That is, from data theft to total control of the machine.

## Consequences

Some of the possible consequences of a NoSQL Injection are:

- **Sensitive data leakage**: If attackers can manipulate the query to obtain sensitive information, they can access data such as passwords, usernames, email addresses, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data.
- **Data modification or deletion:** If attackers can manipulate the query to modify or delete data, they can cause significant damage to the system and stored data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If attackers can manipulate the query to execute malicious code on the server, they can cause a system overload or a Denial of Service (DoS) that can take the website or application offline.
- **Chain vulnerability:** A NoSQL Injection can also be the entry point for a chain of vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities in the application or system to gain further access and control.

> ðŸ“– In summary, a NoSQL Injection can have serious consequences for the security and privacy of data stored in a NoSQL database, which can affect company's reputation, user confidence, and system stability. It is important to take security measures to prevent NoSQL Injection, such as data validation, the use of parameters in queries, and the implementation of firewalls.

## Solution

To prevent NoSQL injection, it is important to implement the following security measures:

- **Data entry validation:** All data entered by users must be validated and filtered to ensure that it does not contain malicious characters that could be exploited in an attack.
- **Permission limitation:** The database must be configured to limit user permissions and only allow access to the functions and data necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data stored in the database should be encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.
- **Security auditing:** There should be an event logging and audit trail system in place to detect any suspicious activity in the database.
- **Security updates:** Keeping the database current with the latest security updates and software patches can reduce exposure to known vulnerabilities.

> ðŸ’¡ In addition, it is important to educate developers and users on good security practices and ensure that all security procedures are documented and easily accessible to the development team.

## Conclusion

In summary, SQL injection testing is an essential tool for web application penetration testers. In this comprehensive exploration, we have dived into the fundamental principles and methodologies that allow us to discover vulnerabilities. We explored manual testing in detail, where in-depth analysis of URLs, forms, and user interactions reveals potential weaknesses.

When it comes to preventing SQL injections, form fields, and validation mechanisms are very important. However, sometimes these measures can hinder the testing process and trained testers may need to use bypass payloads. Automated tools such as SQLmap and Burp Suite are invaluable for performing comprehensive assessments.

We have explained in detail how SQL injection vulnerabilities and blind SQL injection vulnerabilities work. The key to avoiding these vulnerabilities is to sanitize and escape everything you send to the database. In WordPress, the easiest way to do this is to use the prepare() method and placeholders in your SQL. Now that you understand how attackers exploit these vulnerabilities, you can better protect your own and your customers' websites.
