## Difference between active and passive scanning with Nmap

![Nmap](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/nmap.png?raw=true)

Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool used for network scanning and security auditing. In the context of Nmap, both active and passive scans can be performed to obtain information about systems on a network. Here is a brief difference between the two:

## Active Scan

**Definition**: Active scanning involves sending packets directly to targets to obtain information about their services, ports, and operating systems.

> 👉 Example with Nmap: Nmap will send request packets to the target ports and analyze the responses to determine if the ports are open, what services are running, and possibly the software version.

### Features

- More intrusive as it involves interacting directly with the target systems.
- It can be more easily detected by network security systems.

## Passive Analysis

**Definition**: Passive analysis involves listening to or capturing network traffic without directly interacting with the target systems.

> 👉 Example with Nmap: Nmap could use the -sn (Discovery Ping) option to send ping request packets to determine the presence of systems without sending direct packets to ports.

### Features

- Less intrusive and generally more unobtrusive, as it does not send packets directly to target systems.
- May be more difficult to detect, as it does not interact directly with systems on the network.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Purpose:**

- Active analysis is most appropriate when detailed and up-to-date information about target systems needs to be obtained.
- Passive analysis may be preferable when seeking to gather information without alerting target systems.

2. **Risks**

- Active scanning may generate network traffic, which could be detected and monitored by security devices.
- Passive scanning generally has less risk of detection but may have limitations in terms of the quantity and quality of information collected.

3. **Combination**

- In many scenarios, both active and passive analysis are employed to obtain a more complete picture of the network and its systems.

> 📖 Both active and passive analysis have their use cases and should be used ethically and legally, respecting the security and privacy policies of the target network.

## Examples of active scanning with Nmap

Here I provide you with some examples of Nmap commands to perform active scans, focusing on scanning services and ports on a specific target. Note that these examples are illustrative only, and you must ensure that you have the proper authorization to scan any network.

### Basic Port Scanning

```bash
nmap [target]
```

This command performs a basic port scan on the specified target.

### Port Scan with Service Information:

```bash
nmap -sV [target]
```

Provides information about the services running on the found ports.

### Port Scan with Operating System Detection

```bash
nmap -O [target]
```

Attempts to detect the target operating system in addition to performing a port scan.

### Port Scan in a Specific Range

```bash
nmap -p 1-100 [target].
```

Limits the scan to a specific range of ports (in this case, port 1 to 100).

### Aggressive Scan

```bash
nmap -A [target]
```

Performs an aggressive scan that includes service detection, operating system detection, and scripting.

### UDP Port Scan

```bash
nmap -sU [target]
```

Performs a scan of UDP ports, which are used for services such as DNS and DHCP.

### Port Scan with Script Logging

```bash
nmap -sC [target]
```

Runs service and vulnerability detection scripts.

### Port Scan with Specific Output Format

```bash
nmap -oN result.txt [target]
```

Saves the results to a specific text file.

> 💡 Remember to replace [target] with the IP address or hostname of the target you are evaluating. Keep in mind that performing active scans on networks or systems without proper authorization may violate security policies and laws, so always make sure you have permission before using Nmap.

## Examples of Passive Scanning with Nmap

Nmap, by nature, is best known for performing active scans, as it sends packets to target systems to gather information. However, some techniques can be considered more passive compared to a traditional scan. Here, I present you with a few options:

### Discovery Ping

```bash
nmap -sn [target].
```

This command performs a “Discovery Ping” to detect active systems without sending direct packets to ports.

### Detection of Operating Systems without Port Scanning

```bash
nmap -O --unprivileged [target].
```

Performs operating system detection without scanning ports. Uses “--unprivileged” options to avoid requiring root privileges.

### TCP Connect Port Scan

```bash
nmap -sT [target]
```

TCP Connect port scanning can be considered more passive than other methods, as it establishes a full connection to the target.

### Network Scan without Resolving Host Names

```bash
nmap -n [network]
```

When using the `-n` option, Nmap will not attempt to resolve hostnames, which can be considered more passive compared to name resolution.

### Service Version Port Scan without Ping

```bash
nmap -sV -Pn [target].
```

Performs a service version scan without sending pings to determine active systems.

### UDP Port Scan without Resolving Host Names

```bash
nmap -sU -n [target].
```

Performs a UDP port scan without resolving hostnames, which can be considered more passive compared to intensive scans.

> 💡 It is important to note that while these examples are less intrusive, they can still generate network traffic and, in some cases, be detected by security systems. In addition, proper authorization should always be obtained before performing any type of scan or assessment on a network or system.
