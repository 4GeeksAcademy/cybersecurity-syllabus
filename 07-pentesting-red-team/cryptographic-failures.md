In 2013, the infamous data breach at Target Corporation exposed the credit card information of over 40 million customers. One of the key vulnerabilities exploited during this attack was a cryptographic failure. The attackers were able to intercept and decrypt sensitive data due to weak encryption practices, leading to significant financial and reputational damage for the company.

## What are Cryptographic Failures?

Cryptographic failures, previously known as "Sensitive Data Exposure" in the OWASP Top 10, occur when sensitive data is not properly protected through encryption. This can happen due to various reasons, such as using outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms, improper key management, or failing to encrypt data in transit or at rest.

## Common Causes of Cryptographic Failures

1. **Weak or Outdated Algorithms**: Using algorithms that are no longer considered secure, such as MD5 or SHA-1, can make it easier for attackers to decrypt sensitive data.
2. **Improper Key Management**: Failing to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys can lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data.
3. **Lack of Encryption**: Not encrypting sensitive data, either in transit or at rest, leaves it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.
4. **Poor Implementation**: Incorrect implementation of cryptographic protocols can introduce vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

## Example Scenario

Consider a web application that transmits sensitive user information, such as credit card details, over an unencrypted HTTP connection:

```
GET /user/123456 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

If the application does not implement encryption, the credit card details will be exposed to attackers who can intercept the request and decrypt the data.

## How to Prevent Cryptographic Failures

1. **Use Strong Encryption Algorithms**: Implement modern cryptographic algorithms, such as AES, RSA, and ECDH, which are considered secure and widely used.
2. **Secure Key Management**: Implement secure key management practices, such as key rotation and storage in secure locations.
3. **Encrypt Data in Transit**: Use HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
4. **Encrypt Data at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored on the server, such as credit card details, before storing them in the database.
5. **Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure that users are authenticated and authorized to access sensitive data.

By implementing these measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of cryptographic failures and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

These frameworks implement strong password encryption methods to ensure the security of sensitive data in web applications. It is important to follow best practices and keep the encryption methods up to date to prevent cryptographic failures.

## Common Features you should encrypt

Below is a list of common features where popular web development frameworks typically decide to store data encrypted:

1. **User Passwords**: Ensuring that user passwords are stored in an encrypted format to prevent unauthorized access in case of a data breach.
2. **Credit Card Information**: Encrypting credit card details to comply with PCI-DSS standards and protect sensitive financial information.
3. **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**: Encrypting data such as social security numbers, addresses, and phone numbers to protect user privacy.
4. **Session Tokens**: Storing session tokens in an encrypted format to prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access.
5. **API Keys and Secrets**: Encrypting API keys and secrets to secure access to third-party services and prevent misuse.
6. **Database Backups**: Encrypting database backups to ensure that sensitive data remains protected even if the backup files are compromised.
7. **Configuration Files**: Encrypting sensitive information in configuration files, such as database credentials and API keys, to prevent unauthorized access.
8. **Email Addresses**: Encrypting email addresses to protect user identity and prevent spam or phishing attacks.
9. **Health Records**: Encrypting health records to comply with regulations such as HIPAA and protect sensitive medical information.
10. **Financial Transactions**: Encrypting details of financial transactions to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
11. **Cookies**: Encrypting cookies to protect session information and user data stored in cookies from being accessed or tampered with by unauthorized parties.

By encrypting these features, web development frameworks enhance the security of sensitive data and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
