Privilege Escalation

Provide students with low-privilege access to a Windows VM
Have them use tools like PowerUp or WinPEAS to scan for privilege escalation vectors
Guide them through exploiting a misconfigured service or unquoted service path to gain SYSTEM privileges

Living Off The Land

Challenge students to perform various tasks using only built-in Windows binaries (LOLBins)
Examples: Download & execute a payload using certutil.exe, dump credentials with rundll32.exe, etc.
Have them document which techniques were detected/blocked by Windows Defender

Lateral Movement

Set up multiple Windows VMs on a network
Provide initial access to one machine
Have students use tools like CrackMapExec, Mimikatz, and PsExec to move laterally and compromise other hosts

Persistence

After gaining admin access to a Windows VM, have students implement various persistence mechanisms
Examples: Scheduled tasks, startup folder, registry run keys, WMI event subscriptions
Test the persistence by rebooting and verifying regained access

Data Exfiltration

Plant sample "sensitive" files on the Windows target
Challenge students to exfiltrate the data using covert methods
Examples: DNS tunneling, steganography, Slack C2 channel
