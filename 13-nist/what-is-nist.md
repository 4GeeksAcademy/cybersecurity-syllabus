One of the most widely used frameworks in this area is the NIST framework, which helps create action plans in case of threats that could affect business continuity. Here, we explain why this framework is so important for our field!

## What is NIST?

NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States) is an agency that develops and promotes standards in technology and security.

> 💡 Although NIST is a U.S. agency, its Cybersecurity Framework is not limited to the United States. In fact, it has been adopted and adapted globally.

It is crucial in cybersecurity because it:

1. Develops standards for systems, IT security, and other technological areas.
2. Ensures compatibility and security in systems and networks.
3. Provides the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a guide to assess and improve cybersecurity posture in organizations.
4. Conducts research on cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
5. Drives innovation in protection solutions for systems and networks.

## Introduction to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a comprehensive guide for assessing and managing cybersecurity in organizations. Its main features are:

1. Structured approach based on best practices.
2. Promotes systematic resilience against vulnerabilities and threats.
3. Provides procedures to protect against cyber threats.
4. Addresses legal and moral obligations regarding security and privacy.
5. Offers flexibility and adaptability to specific needs.
6. Is regularly updated to remain relevant to new threats.

This framework has become a popular reference in the technology field due to its comprehensive and adaptable approach to information security challenges.

### Objectives and Benefits of Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

> 🔥 The main objective of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is to help organizations understand and manage cyber risks effectively.

The framework is based on five main functions:

✅ Identify.

✅ Protect.

✅ Detect.

✅ Respond.

✅ Recover.

These functions are applied through a series of categories and subcategories that address specific aspects of cybersecurity, such as risk management, data protection, threat detection, and incident response.

In summary, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework has several key objectives:

1. Improve the cybersecurity posture of organizations by identifying areas for improvement and setting clear goals.
2. Foster a culture of cybersecurity throughout the organization, promoting awareness and responsibility among all members.
3. Help comply with cybersecurity regulatory and legal requirements.
4. Effectively assess and manage cyber risks.
5. Strengthen the ability to protect information assets and respond to cyber threats.

Implementing this framework is crucial for establishing a strong security culture and meeting industry standards.
