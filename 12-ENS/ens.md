> 🇪🇸 If you are not going to work in 🇪🇸 Spain, this topic will be irrelevant to you, and you can skip the entire topic. Alternatives to ENS in other countries: NIST Cybersecurity Framework 🇺🇸, [ISO 27001](https://4geeks.com/lesson/introduction-to-iso-27001) 🌎, IT-Grundschutz 🇩🇪, NERC CIP 🇺🇸, CERC 🇨🇦, NIS Directive 🇪🇺, CNSSI 1253 🇨🇳

In some cases during our career as cybersecurity analysts in 🇪🇸 Spain, we will have to perform audits on systems of public organizations that are governed by the ENS, so it is necessary to have knowledge about this.

Among the topics we will be covering about ENS, we will have frameworks, protection measures, and risk analyses, as well as certain tools that will help us implement the scheme. Without further ado, let's get into the topic.

# Introduction to ENS (Spain National Security Scheme) 🛡️🇪🇸

The National Security Scheme (ENS) is a regulatory framework established by the Spanish government to **ensure the security of information systems used by public administrations**. This scheme is fundamental for protecting the information and services handled by government entities. 🏛️💻

## Objectives of ENS 🎯

The main objectives of ENS are:

1. Create the necessary conditions for trust in the use of electronic means. 🤝
2. Promote continuous security management. 🔄
3. Provide a common language for interaction between administrations in matters of security. 🗣️

## Basic Principles 📊

ENS is based on the following principles:

- Comprehensive security 🔐
- Risk management ⚠️
- Prevention, reaction, and recovery 🚨
- Lines of defense 🛡️
- Periodic reassessment 🔄
- Differentiated function 🔀

### Comprehensive Security 🔐

Comprehensive security involves protecting all aspects of security, including infrastructure, data, systems, and services. For example:

- Protecting the physical infrastructure of information systems.
- Training the humans working in the organization.
- Protecting the data of information systems.
- Protecting information systems.
- Protecting the services of information systems.

### Risk Management ⚠️

Risk management involves identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks that affect the security of information systems. For example:

- Identifying risks that affect the security of information systems.
- Evaluating risks that affect the security of information systems.
- Mitigating risks that affect the security of information systems.

### Prevention, Reaction, and Recovery 🚨

Prevention involves detecting and mitigating risks before they occur. Reaction involves responding to security incidents, and recovery involves restoring information systems to their original state. For example:

- Detecting and mitigating risks before they occur.
- Responding to security incidents.
- Restoring information systems to their original state.

### Lines of Defense 🛡️

Lines of defense are the measures and controls implemented to protect information systems. For example:

- Implementing security controls.
- Implementing protection measures.
- Implementing recovery measures.

### Periodic Reassessment 🔄

Periodic reassessment involves reviewing and updating security controls to ensure they remain effective. For example:

- Reviewing and updating security controls.
- Reviewing and updating protection measures.
- Reviewing and updating recovery measures.

### Differentiated Function 🔀

Differentiated function involves differentiating between those responsible and their main functions. This includes those responsible for information, service, and security.

## Security Measures 🔒

ENS establishes three security levels (low, medium, and high) and defines security measures in several categories:

- Organizational framework 📋
- Operational framework 🛠️
- Protection measures 🔐

These measures cover aspects such as security policy, risk management, staff training, access control, facility protection, incident management, among others. 👥🚪🏢🚨

## Implementation and Compliance ✅

Public organizations must:

1. Conduct a risk analysis. 📊
2. Prepare a statement of applicability. 📝
3. Develop an adaptation plan. 📅
4. Implement security measures. 🔒
5. Conduct periodic audits. 🔍

Compliance with ENS is mandatory for all Spanish public administrations and is supervised by the National Cryptologic Center (CCN). 🏛️👀

## ENS Certification 🏅

The National Security Scheme (ENS) certification is a process by which an organization demonstrates its compliance with the requirements established by the ENS. This certification is especially relevant for public administrations and entities that provide services to the public sector.

### Certification Process 📋

The ENS certification process generally includes the following steps:

1. Self-assessment: The organization conducts an internal evaluation of its compliance with the ENS.

2. Audit: An accredited certification entity conducts a thorough audit of the information system.

3. Conformity report: If the audit is satisfactory, a conformity report is issued.

4. Certification: The National Cryptologic Center (CCN) reviews the report and, if approved, issues the certificate of conformity.

### Certification Levels 🏆

ENS certification is granted based on established security levels:

- Basic
- Medium
- High

### Importance of Certification 🌟

- Demonstrates commitment to information security.
- It is mandatory for certain information systems of public administrations.
- It can be a requirement to participate in public tenders.
- Increases trust from citizens and other organizations.

### Validity and Renewal ⏳

ENS certification is valid for 2 years, after which it must be renewed through a new audit.

This certification is not only a legal requirement for many public entities, but also represents a quality seal in terms of information security in the field of Spanish electronic administration.

## Difference between ENS and ISO 27001 🤔

The National Security Scheme (ENS) and the ISO 27001 standard are two different information security management systems.

The following table shows the main differences and similarities between ENS and ISO 27001, highlighting their unique characteristics and areas of compatibility.

| Characteristic | ENS | ISO 27001 |
|----------------|-----|-----------|
| Scope of application | Specific to Spain | International |
| Mandatory nature | Mandatory for Spanish public administrations | Voluntary |
| Focus | Information security in the public sector | Information security management in any organization |
| Regulatory body | National Cryptologic Center (CCN) | International Organization for Standardization (ISO) |
| Structure | Based on security levels (low, medium, high) | Based on security controls |
| Certification | Valid for 2 years | Valid for 3 years |
| Security measures | 75 specific measures | 114 controls in 14 domains |
| Risk analysis | Mandatory | Mandatory |
| Continuous improvement | Yes | Yes |
| Compatibility | Compatible with ISO 27001 | Compatible with ENS |

### Is ISO 27001 certification sufficient to comply with ENS? 🤔

Although ISO 27001 certification is an important step towards information security, it is not sufficient on its own to fully comply with ENS requirements. Here's why:

1. **Additional requirements**: ENS has specific requirements that are not covered by ISO 27001, such as specific security measures for low, medium, and high levels.

2. **Legal framework**: ENS is a legal requirement for Spanish public administrations, while ISO 27001 is voluntary.

3. **Audit and certification**: The ENS certification process is different from ISO 27001, including the involvement of the National Cryptologic Center (CCN).

4. **Security measures**: ENS defines 75 specific security measures, while ISO 27001 is based on 114 controls in 14 domains that do not always coincide with ENS measures.

However, it's important to note that there is significant compatibility between both standards. Implementing ISO 27001 can provide a solid foundation for meeting many of the ENS requirements, facilitating the ENS certification process.

> 💡 If your organization is already ISO 27001 certified and needs to comply with ENS, consider conducting a gap analysis to identify the additional ENS requirements you need to implement. This will allow you to leverage the work already done for ISO 27001 and focus on the specific aspects of ENS.


## Conclusion 🏁

ENS plays a crucial role in cybersecurity in the Spanish public sector, providing a common framework for the protection of information and electronic services. Its effective implementation is essential to ensure trust in e-government and protect citizens' data. 🔐🇪🇸👥
