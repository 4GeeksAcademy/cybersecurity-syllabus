# ENS Implementation and Security Measures

> Before we start, we thoroughly cover ENS (Esquema Nacional de Seguridad) in several lessons. This lesson soly focused on the security measures and implementation.
> Read an [Introduction to ENS](https://4geeks.com/lesson/spain-national-security-scheme-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad) and learn more about the [ENS Organizational and operational framework](https://4geeks.com/lesson/ens-organizational-and-operational-framework).

In order to implement Spain's üá™üá∏ National Security Framework (ENS) we first need to name a committee that will be responsible for the implementation of the scheme.

## Who is responsible for the implementation of the ENS inside an organization?

Since 2022 ENS is governed by [Real Decreto 311/2022](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2022-12345) and establishes 4 roles in 2 levels according to its article 11. These roles are also detailed in [the Gu√≠a 801 of the National Cryptographic Center](https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/es/series-ccn-stic/800-guia-esquema-nacional-de-seguridad/501-ccn-stic-801-responsabilidades-y-funciones-en-el-ens/file?format=html).

### Committee composition

> üí° While the ENS defines distinct roles with specific responsibilities, it's important to note that in practice, especially in smaller organizations or those with limited resources

This committee will be composed of a president who will have the role of moderator of the meetings and in case of a tie vote, he will have the casting vote, some members who will have voice and vote within the meetings and a secretary of the committee who is in charge of the convocations and reads the minutes of the last meetings:


### Information Officer üßë‚Äçüíºüìä

Determines the security requirements of the information treated according to the parameters of Annex I of the ENS. It can be a person or a collegiate body.

### Service Responsible üõ†Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüíº

## Implementation of the ENS

![ENS Implementation](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/cybersecurity-syllabus/blob/main/assets/12-ens/proceso-ens.png?raw=true)

To implement an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that complies with Spain‚Äôs **Esquema Nacional de Seguridad (ENS)**, you'll need to follow a structured approach that aligns with the regulatory framework. Below is a step-by-step implementation plan:

### 1. **Understand the ENS Requirements**

- **Classification of systems:** The ENS defines different levels of security (Basic, Intermediate, and High). Start by classifying your information systems based on the sensitivity and criticality of the data handled.
- **Security Measures:** Each level requires specific security measures (administrative, technical, and operational). Review Annex II and Annex III of the ENS for the detailed requirements.
- **Legal Review:** Current state of the organization compliance with related Spanish laws (e.g., GDPR, Spanish Data Protection Act).

### 2. **Gap Analysis**

- **Current State Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of your current security posture. Evaluate existing security measures, policies, and procedures.
- **Gap Identification:** Compare your current security controls against the ENS requirements. Identify gaps in both technical (e.g., firewalls, encryption) and organizational (e.g., policies, risk management) aspects.

### 3. **Set Up a Security Governance Framework**

- **Appoint a Security Officer:** Designate a security officer responsible for ENS compliance and ensure they are appropriately trained.
- **Create a Security Committee:** Establish a committee with representatives from IT, legal, HR, and other relevant departments to oversee the security program.

### 4. **Develop the ISMS Framework**

- **Policy Development:** Create or update information security policies to reflect ENS requirements. Include policies on access control, incident management, and data classification.
- **Risk Management Process:** Implement a formal risk management process, including risk identification, assessment, and treatment. Ensure that the risk management strategy aligns with ENS guidelines.
- **Asset Management:** Identify and classify assets (hardware, software, data) according to their importance to your organization. Define appropriate protection measures for each asset.

### 5. **Technical Security Controls Implementation**

- **Encryption:** Use strong encryption for sensitive data in storage and transit.
- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) and two-factor authentication (2FA) for all critical systems.
- **Monitoring and Incident Detection:** Install monitoring tools (SIEM, IDS/IPS) to detect and respond to incidents. Align this with Spain's regulatory requirements for incident reporting.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Establish a reliable backup and disaster recovery system. Ensure that backups are encrypted and regularly tested.
- **Perimeter Security:** Harden perimeter defenses using firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation.

### 6. **Administrative and Organizational Measures**

- **Awareness and Training Programs:** Develop and execute a security awareness program for all employees, covering topics like phishing, safe data handling, and reporting incidents.
- **Incident Response Plan:** Create an incident response plan that complies with ENS guidelines. Ensure it covers incident detection, response, recovery, and reporting.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Set up a monitoring process for security threats, ensuring periodic audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted.

### 7. **Third-Party and Supplier Management**

- **Supplier Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the security measures of third-party service providers to ensure they comply with ENS requirements.
- **Contractual Obligations:** Incorporate ENS-related clauses into contracts with suppliers and partners, especially those handling sensitive information.

### 8. **Audit and Certification**

- **Internal Audit:** Perform regular internal audits to ensure ongoing compliance with ENS. Address any non-conformities identified during the audits.
- **ENS Certification:** Engage with accredited auditors to obtain ENS certification. This step is crucial for public administrations and suppliers working with the public sector.
- **External Audit:** Depending on your security level, you may need to undergo an external audit for official certification (particularly for Intermediate and High levels).

### 9. **Incident Management and Reporting**

- **Incident Handling Process:** Implement a formal process for incident reporting and response. Ensure that incidents are reported to the relevant authorities, following the ENS guidelines.
- **Continuous Improvement:** After incidents, conduct a post-mortem to update the ISMS and prevent similar incidents in the future.

### 10. **Documentation and Reporting**

- **Security Plan:** Document the security plan, which should include objectives, risk management approaches, and security measures in line with ENS.
- **Conformity Reports:** Produce regular conformity reports that demonstrate adherence to ENS requirements.
- **Communication with Authorities:** Ensure regular communication with regulatory authorities for incident reporting and certifications.

### 11. **Continuous Improvement**

- **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update your ISMS to align with evolving threats and ENS updates.
- **Penetration Testing:** Conduct annual penetration tests to assess the effectiveness of your security controls.
- **Employee Re-training:** Regularly refresh employees' security awareness through ongoing training programs.

## ENS Protective Measures

The following is a list of all the protective measures that we must implement to comply with the ENS.

### Protection of facilities üîíüè¢

The protection of facilities stands as a fundamental pillar in the National Security Scheme, playing a critical role in preserving the integrity and information of a public entity. This component, which ranges from strategic infrastructures to key buildings, becomes an essential link for secure and sustainable development.

The protection of facilities refers to the application of measures and strategies aimed at physically and strategically safeguarding places and structures considered crucial for the functioning and well-being of a society. These facilities can range from power plants and water treatment plants to government buildings and research centers.

Among its controls we have:

#### Separate areas with access control üîíüöß
