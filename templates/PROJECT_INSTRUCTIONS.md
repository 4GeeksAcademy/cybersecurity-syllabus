## üö© Project Objective



## üå± How to start this project?

In this section we specify the first steps to start the project:

- Do students need to download a file?
- Do students need to clone a github repository? if so, please provide the URL and cloning instructions.
- Do students need to install a software?
- Do students need to create a virtual machine based on an image?
- Any other special requirement?

## üìù Instructions

Create a simulated network environment that includes a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), configure firewalls, gateways, and network detection systems, and ensure network security.

### Components:

1. **Network Design:**
   - Design a network layout that includes a DMZ, internal network, and external network.
   - Set up virtual machines or use a network simulation tool to create the network environment.

2. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Configure firewalls to segment the network into DMZ and internal networks.
   - Set up firewall rules to control traffic between the internal network, DMZ, and external network.

3. **DMZ Setup:**
   - Deploy services in the DMZ such as a web server, mail server, or DNS server.
   - Ensure that the DMZ is isolated from the internal network but still accessible from the external network.

4. **Gateway or Proxy Server:**
   - Configure a gateway or proxy server to manage traffic between the internal network and the external network.
   - Implement access control policies on the proxy server.

5. **Network Detection and Response (NDR):**
   - Deploy and configure NDR tools to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activities.
   - Set up alerts and logging for network events.

6. **Security Testing:**
   - Perform network scans and vulnerability assessments using tools like Nmap to identify potential security issues.
   - Test the firewall rules and network segmentation to ensure that unauthorized access is prevented.

7. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document the network design, firewall rules, and security configurations.
   - Prepare a report summarizing the project, including any vulnerabilities discovered and the steps taken to address them.

This project will give participants hands-on experience with configuring and securing a network environment, applying the concepts of network defense, firewalls, DMZ, and network detection and response.

## üöõ How to deliver this project?

Once you've finished the Packet Tracer instruction steps, please save your changes and attach the file to the 4geeks.com platform in the corresponding project.

- Configuration of the Internal, External, and DMZ networks in the proposed network design.
- Configuration of the firewall and gateway to control traffic between the internal, external, and DMZ environments.
- Screenshots of access and traffic blocking tests between the specified environments.
- Report detailing the proposed design's applied security measures and security recommendations.
