The **OWASP Top 10** is the most important thing you need to know about cybersecurity. It is the reason cybersecurity exists. It‚Äôs 99% of what you need to learn to investigate, prevent, explore, exploit, document, and every other verb ending in `ar` in the dictionary. The Spanish language doesn't have words to express how important it is to master the OWASP Top 10. üö®

## üîç But, what is the OWASP Top 10?

There is a non-profit foundation called **OWASP** (Open Web Application Security Project) that is responsible for maintaining and publishing a list of the world's most important and frequent vulnerabilities in organizations. In reality, there are several lists, but during the cybersecurity bootcamp, we will focus only on the main list, and then it‚Äôs up to you to learn about the others.

## üìã List of OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities for 2021

On the official OWASP website, you can see that the latest list was published in 2021 and consists of the following categories or groups of vulnerabilities:

### üîì A01:2021 ‚Äì Broken Access Control
- **Description:** This category includes flaws that allow users to access data or functions outside their intended permissions. It is the most common and critical vulnerability, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.

### üîê A02:2021 ‚Äì Cryptographic Failures (formerly known as Sensitive Data Exposure)
- **Description:** This refers to weaknesses in cryptographic processes that can lead to the exposure of sensitive data. Issues include insufficient encryption, insecure key management, and the use of weak algorithms.

### üíâ A03:2021 ‚Äì Injection
- **Description:** Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. SQL injection is the most well-known example, but it also includes NoSQL injection, OS command injection, and others.

### üèóÔ∏è A04:2021 ‚Äì Insecure Design
- **Description:** This category addresses the risks associated with insecure design patterns and a lack of secure design principles, such as secure architecture and threat modeling.

### ‚öôÔ∏è A05:2021 ‚Äì Security Misconfiguration
- **Description:** Security misconfiguration is the result of insecure default configurations, incomplete configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages that reveal sensitive information.

### üß© A06:2021 ‚Äì Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- **Description:** This involves the use of software components with known vulnerabilities that are often left unpatched or are outdated, potentially leading to a breach.

### üÜî A07:2021 ‚Äì Identification and Authentication Failures
- **Description:** Formerly known as Broken Authentication, this category involves failures in the authentication process, such as improper implementation of authentication mechanisms, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access.

### üõ†Ô∏è A08:2021 ‚Äì Software and Data Integrity Failures
- **Description:** This new category includes issues like insecure deserialization, where data is not properly validated before being processed, and vulnerabilities related to Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

### üìâ A09:2021 ‚Äì Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- **Description:** Insufficient logging and monitoring can prevent the timely detection of breaches and attacks, leading to prolonged unauthorized access and data loss.

### üåê A10:2021 ‚Äì Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Description:** SSRF occurs when a web application is tricked into making unauthorized requests to another service, often leading to the exposure of internal services, sensitive data, or other attacks.

## üîß What to do with the OWASP Top 10?

Prepare yourself to protect a company against the OWASP Top 10, but do so in a professional manner and in compliance with all industry standards, including documentation for different [global cybersecurity regulations](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/cumplimiento-legal-y-normativo).

To be considered a successful cybersecurity professional in relation to the OWASP Top 10, you should be able to:

- **Understand the OWASP Top 10:**  
  Clearly explain each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, including their impact on web applications.

- **Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities:**  
  Perform security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and demonstrate how they could be exploited by attackers.

- **Mitigate Vulnerabilities:**  
  Apply best security practices to mitigate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, such as input validation and secure coding.

- **Conduct Code Reviews:**  
  Conduct code reviews focused on identifying and correcting OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

- **Implement Security Testing:**  
  Integrate security testing focused on the OWASP Top 10 into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

- **Configure and Use Security Tools:**  
  Configure WAFs and use security tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Communicate and Document Security:**  
  Effectively communicate security risks and develop policies to ensure that vulnerabilities are consistently addressed.

- **Stay Updated:**  
  Continuously improve and update your knowledge of the latest threats and best practices related to the OWASP Top 10.

## üåç What is the Open Web Application Security Project?

**OWASP** (Open Web Application Security Project) is a global non-profit organization dedicated to improving software security. Founded in 2001, OWASP is widely recognized in the cybersecurity industry for its focus on web application security and its contribution with resources, tools, and documentation that help developers and organizations protect their applications.

### Main Features of OWASP:

- **Open Projects:** OWASP is known for its numerous security projects, including the **OWASP Top 10**, which identifies the most critical vulnerabilities in web applications. Other important projects include security testing tools, secure development guides, and educational resources.

- **Global Community:** OWASP is driven by a global community of volunteers, including developers, security professionals, researchers, and educators. These volunteers contribute to projects, participate in conferences, and collaborate to improve security practices in software development.

- **Education and Awareness:** OWASP organizes conferences, workshops, and training sessions worldwide. Its goal is to educate the developer community and organizations about the importance of application security and provide the tools and knowledge needed to implement secure practices.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Who Works at OWASP?

- **Volunteers:** Most of the work at OWASP is done by volunteers. These can be security professionals, developers, academics, or simply people interested in software security. Volunteers contribute in various ways, from developing tools to creating educational content and organizing events.

- **Community Members:** OWASP has a global membership that includes both individuals and organizations. Members typically participate actively in OWASP projects, conferences, and other initiatives.

- **Administrative Staff:** Although OWASP is primarily volunteer-driven, it also has a small administrative team that handles the organization's daily management, coordinates global events, and maintains the infrastructure that supports the community.

- **Steering Committee and Project Leaders:** OWASP has a global steering committee composed of community leaders who make strategic decisions about the organization's direction. Additionally, each OWASP project has its own leaders who coordinate the work and development of the project.

### üõ†Ô∏è OWASP Contributions:

OWASP is responsible for a large number of tools and resources that are freely accessible and used by the global community. Some of the most well-known include:

- **OWASP Top 10:** A report that ranks the ten most critical vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):** A popular tool for performing security testing on web applications.
- **OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard):** A standard for verifying application security.
- **OWASP Dependency-Check:** A tool for analyzing dependencies in software projects and detecting known vulnerabilities.

### üìö Summary

OWASP is a fundamental organization in the world of cybersecurity, focused on web application security. It is primarily driven by a passionate community of volunteers who work together to create and maintain projects, tools, and educational resources that benefit the entire developer community and organizations seeking to improve the security of their applications.
