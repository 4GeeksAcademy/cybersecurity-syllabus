Cyber threats, cyber incidents, cyber-attacks. The daily struggle against these three is routine for cybersecurity professionals, and it's time for you to learn about the most common cyber threats and attacks.

### Difference between Cyber Threat and Cyber Attack

The difference between a cyber threat and a cyber attack lies in their nature and stages:

| Cyber Threat | Cyber Attack |
| --- | --- |
| A cyber threat refers to any event or circumstance that has the potential to compromise the security of a system, network, or data. | A cyber attack is a deliberate and malicious act directed at a system, network, or data to cause harm, theft, disruption, or compromise. |
| Cyber threats are potential dangers or vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals to carry out a cyber attack. | Cyber attacks are specific actions taken by cybercriminals to exploit a cyber threat and achieve a malicious objective. |
| Cyber threats can be internal or external and may include software vulnerabilities, human errors, lack of security patches, and more. | Cyber attacks can include activities such as malware, phishing, ransomware, unauthorized access, and denial of service (DoS), among others. |

### The 10 Common Cyber Threats:

1. **Software Vulnerabilities:** Errors and weaknesses in software that can be exploited by attackers.
2. **Obsolete Software or Hardware:** Outdated software may have security flaws against new attacker technologies.
3. **Weak or Open Access WiFi Networks:** Equivalent to leaving the office door open. A WiFi network with a weak or no password is an open door for any user, including attackers.
4. **Social Engineering:** Involves psychological manipulation and blackmail to deceive people and obtain unauthorized information or access. It is considered a threat or a cyber attack depending on the context. Any attempt at psychological manipulation can have potential risks if executed by the attacker.
5. **Unnecessarily Open Ports or Unmonitored Networks:** In week 2, you learned about network fundamentals and what protocols and services can do. A network without proper monitoring can be an attack channel for a cybercriminal.
6. **Weak Passwords:** More susceptible to brute force attacks. A brute force attack involves attempting to guess the password using dictionaries and offensive security tools.

### The 10 Most Common Cyber Attacks:

1. **Ransomware:** A type of malware that encrypts a system's information and demands a ransom (money) for its release; essentially, it is a kidnapping of information.
2. **Phishing:** Sending fake emails to steal confidential information.
3. **Zero-Day Attack:** Exploitation of software vulnerabilities before patches are known and published.
4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** Interception and manipulation of communication between two parties.
5. **Brute Force Attack:** Repeated attempts to guess passwords.
6. **SQL Injection Attack:** Insertion of malicious SQL code into web applications.
7. **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) Attack:** Saturating servers or networks to disable services.
8. **Identity Spoofing Attack:** Deceiving systems or users by pretending to be another entity.
9. **Data Exfiltration Attack:** Unauthorized theft and transfer of sensitive data.
10. **Unauthorized Access Attack:** Infiltration into systems or networks without permission.
