# Virtual Machines and projects to practice cybersecurity

At 4Geeks, we like our students to learn in real-life environments similar to those they will find once they get a job in the field. That is why we like using virtual machines instead of cloud services like HackABox, TryHackMe, etc. We recommend using cloud services once you get familiar with installing and using real-life setups.

On the other hand, using a virtual machine is strongly recommended because you will be hacking a lot. You don't want your personal computer to become vulnerable or hacked; using virtual machines (VMs) is a great way to learn cybersecurity in a controlled and isolated environment. 

We use a mix of [internally developed](https://4geeks.com/docs/start/cybersecurity-virtual-machines) and/or publicly available VMs designed specifically for security training, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. These include pre-configured vulnerable applications and systems, which are ideal for practicing penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation.

## 1. Metasploitable 2 and 3

  - Exploit known vulnerabilities in services like FTP, SSH, and HTTP.
  - Practice securing misconfigured services and permissions.
  - Use tools like Nmap and Metasploit to conduct penetration testing.
  - Service Enumeration: Use tools like Nmap to identify open ports and services running on the VM.
  - FTP Exploitation: Exploit vulnerable FTP services to gain unauthorized access or read/write files.
  - Apache Misconfigurations: Identify and exploit common misconfigurations in the Apache server.
  - Samba Shares Exploitation: Gain unauthorized access through misconfigured Samba shares.

  - Work through lessons that explain vulnerabilities with hands-on tasks.
  - Mitigate vulnerabilities in simulated scenarios.
  - Develop secure code patches for identified issues.
  - Authentication Flaws: Learn about flaws in authentication mechanisms and how to exploit them.
  - Access Control Flaws: Understand broken access controls and practice bypassing access controls.
  - Secure Code Review: Perform code reviews to identify security flaws in source code.
  - Injection Flaws: Practice exploiting various injection flaws, including SQL, XML, and LDAP injection.
  - Concurrency Flaws: Exploit concurrency to perform tasks like money transfer without proper synchronization.

## 4. OWASP Juice Shop

- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate
