In 2017 the Equifax data breach included sensitive personal and financial information of approximately 147 million Americans was exposed. Equifax agreed to a global settlement of up to $425 million to help people affected by the data breach. 

> The Equifax data breach was a result of inadequate Data Loss Prevention (DLP) measures, among other security failures.

While DLP alone might not have prevented the breach entirely, robust DLP policies and technologies could have significantly mitigated the impact or potentially detected the breach earlier. Here's why:

1. **Lack of Data Discovery and Classification**: Effective DLP starts with knowing what sensitive data you have and where it's located. Equifax failed to properly identify and classify all of its sensitive data, which is a crucial first step in DLP.

2. **Insufficient Data Access Controls**: DLP involves controlling who has access to sensitive data. Equifax's breach was partly due to a failure to properly restrict access to critical systems and data.

3. **Inadequate Monitoring and Detection**: DLP systems can monitor data movement and alert on suspicious activities. Equifax's breach went undetected for months, indicating a lack of proper monitoring.

4. **Poor Data Encryption**: DLP often includes encryption of sensitive data. Much of the stolen Equifax data was unencrypted, making it easily usable by the attackers.

5. **Ineffective Data Exfiltration Prevention**: DLP technologies can prevent large amounts of data from being extracted from the network. The fact that attackers were able to exfiltrate data for 76 days suggests a lack of such controls.

This case underscores the critical importance of implementing comprehensive DLP strategies to protect sensitive data and detect potential breaches early.

## Definition and Importance of DLP

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of sensitive information. DLP is crucial in today's digital landscape for several reasons:

1. **Protection of Sensitive Data**: DLP helps organizations safeguard their most valuable asset - information.
2. **Compliance**: Many industries are subject to regulations that require the protection of specific types of data.
3. **Reputation Management**: Data breaches can severely damage an organization's reputation and customer trust.
4. **Insider Threat Mitigation**: DLP can help prevent both accidental and intentional data leaks by employees.

## Types of Sensitive Data

Organizations typically deal with various types of sensitive data, including:

1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
   - Names, addresses, social security numbers
   - Date of birth, phone numbers, email addresses

2. **Financial Information**
   - Credit card numbers, bank account details
   - Financial statements, tax information

3. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**
   - Medical records, prescription information
   - Insurance details, patient data

4. **Intellectual Property (IP)**
   - Trade secrets, product designs
   - Source code, research data

5. **Business-Sensitive Information**
   - Strategic plans, merger and acquisition details
   - Customer lists, pricing information

## Data Leakage Channels

Sensitive data can be leaked through various channels:

1. **Email and Messaging**
   - Sending sensitive information to unauthorized recipients
   - Using personal email accounts for business communication

2. **Cloud Storage and File Sharing**
   - Uploading sensitive data to unsecured cloud services
   - Sharing files with overly broad permissions

3. **Removable Media**
   - Copying data to USB drives, external hard disks
   - Using personal devices to store company data

4. **Printing and Physical Documents**
   - Leaving sensitive documents unattended
   - Improper disposal of printed materials

5. **Web and Social Media**
   - Posting confidential information on public websites
   - Sharing sensitive data on social media platforms

6. **Network Traffic**
   - Unencrypted data transmission
   - Man-in-the-middle attacks

7. **Mobile Devices**
   - Lost or stolen devices containing sensitive data
   - Use of unsecured personal devices for work

Understanding these channels is crucial for implementing effective DLP strategies and technologies, which we'll explore in the next lesson.
