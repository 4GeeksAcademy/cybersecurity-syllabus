# Regulatory Compliance

Making sure that the organization complies with the regulations is the most important part of DLP. This is true because non-compliance can lead to severe finantial penalties, damage the organization's reputation or even put the organization out of business.

The following are the most important regulations that affect DLP:

1. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Applies to organizations handling EU residents' personal data
2. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Applies to healthcare organizations and their business associates in the US
3. PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Applies to organizations handling credit card information

## GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

One of the most famous cases of financial penalties for breaking GDPR is the [â‚¬746 million fine imposed on Amazon in July 2021 by Luxembourg's data protection authority](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-hit-with-886-million-eu-data-privacy-fine-2021-07-30/). This record-breaking fine was issued for alleged violations of GDPR related to Amazon's advertising practices and how it processed personal data.

### Key aspects of GDPR

- Requires organizations to have "Lawfulness of processing". It means that the organization must have a valid reason for processing the data, such as consent from the data subject or a contract.
- Mandates the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for certain organizations, responsible for ensuring that the organization complies with the GDPR. The DPO is not personally liable for data protection compliance, but the organization remains responsible for compliance and may face penalties for non-compliance.
- Requires implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security. This includes measures such as encryption, access control, and data minimization.
- Mandates conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) for high-risk processing activities (like training an AI). It can be done internally or by an external DPO.
- Requires maintaining a record of processing activities. This is known as "Records of processing activities". It includes information about the purposes of the processing, the categories of data subjects, and the measures taken to ensure data security.
- Requires obtaining explicit consent for processing sensitive personal data. This is known as "Consent". It means that the data subject must actively agree to the processing of their data.
- Requires organizations to provide data subjects with access to their personal data upon request. This is known as "Subject access request".
- Mandates the implementation of data protection by design and by default. This means that the organization must design and implement its data processing activities in a way that ensures compliance with the GDPR from the beginning.
- Requires organizations to report data breaches to supervisory authorities within 72 hours. This is known as "Breach notification".
- Mandates the inclusion of specific clauses in contracts with data processors. This is known as "Standard Contractual Clauses".
- Requires organizations to report data breaches to supervisory authorities within 72 hours
- Mandates conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) for high-risk processing activities
- Requires maintaining a record of processing activities
- Mandates obtaining explicit consent for processing sensitive personal data
- Requires organizations to provide data subjects with access to their personal data upon request
- Mandates the implementation of data protection by design and by default
- Requires organizations to report data breaches to supervisory authorities within 72 hours
- Mandates the inclusion of specific clauses in contracts with data processors

### PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

- Applies to organizations handling credit card information
- Requires protection of cardholder data
- Mandates regular security assessments and incident response procedures

## Reporting and Documentation

Proper reporting and documentation are crucial for regulatory compliance and improving incident response. Key elements include:

1. **Incident Reports**: Detailed accounts of each incident, including timeline, actions taken, and outcomes.

2. **Breach Notification**: Templates and procedures for notifying affected individuals and regulatory bodies when required.

3. **Incident Log**: A comprehensive record of all DLP incidents, responses, and outcomes.

4. **Policy Updates**: Documentation of any policy or procedure changes made in response to incidents.

5. **Training Records**: Documentation of employee training on DLP policies and incident response procedures.

By following a structured incident response process, understanding key regulations, and maintaining thorough documentation, organizations can effectively manage DLP incidents and maintain regulatory compliance.
